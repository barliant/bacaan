  Abstract                 = {In our previous work we developed a method for extracting fuzzy rules directly from numerical data for pattern classification. The performance of the fuzzy classifier developed using this methodology was comparable to the average performance of neural networks. In this paper, we further develop two methods, a least squares method and an iterative method, for tuning the sensitivity parameters of fuzzy membership functions by which the generalization ability of the classifier is improved. We evaluate our methods using the Fisher iris data and data for numeral recognition of vehicle license plates. The results show that when the tuned sensitivity parameters are applied, the recognition rates are improved to the extent that performance is comparable to or better than the maximum performance obtained by neural networks, but with shorter computational time.},

However, the available tools usually focus on the accurate identification of raw repeats and provide no information about the taxonomic position of the reconstructed consensi. TEclass is a tool to classify unknown transposable elements into their four main functional categories, which reflect their mode of transposition: DNA transposons, long terminal repeats (LTRs), long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs). TEclass uses machine learning support vector machine (SVM) for classification based on oligomer frequencies. It achieves 90-97\% accuracy in the classification of novel DNA and LTR repeats, and 75\% for LINEs and SINEs.

  Abstract                 = {The genomes of birds are much smaller than mammalian genomes, and transposable elements (TEs) make up only 10\% of the chicken genome, compared with the 45\% of the human genome. To study the mechanisms that constrain the copy numbers of TEs, and as a consequence the genome size of birds, we analyzed the distributions of LINEs (CR1's) and SINEs (MIRs) on the chicken autosomes and Z chromosome. We show that (1) CR1 repeats are longest on the Z chromosome and their length is negatively correlated with the local GC content; (2) the decay of CR1 elements is highly biased, and the 5'-ends of the insertions are lost much faster than their 3'-ends; (3) the GC distribution of CR1 repeats shows a bimodal pattern with repeats enriched in both AT-rich and GC-rich regions of the genome, but the CR1 families show large differences in their GC distribution; and (4) the few MIRs in the chicken are most abundant in regions with intermediate GC content. Our results indicate that the primary mechanism that removes repeats from the chicken genome is ectopic exchange and that the low abundance of repeats in avian genomes is likely to be the consequence of their high recombination rates.},

Finally, we show that, in books, American English has become decidedly more "emotional" than British English in the last half-century, as a part of a more general increase of the stylistic divergence between the two variants of English language.},

While there are efficient methods for detecting strict repeats or detecting already characterized repeats, there is no software available for detecting approximate repeats in large DNA sequences allowing for weighted substitutions and indels in a coherent statistical framework. Here, we present an implementation of a two-steps method (seed detection followed by their extension) that detects those approximate repeats. Our method is computationally efficient enough to handle large sequences and is flexible enough to account for influencing factors, such as sequence-composition biases both at the seed detection and alignment levels.

  Abstract                 = {Summary: Most cellular tasks are performed not by individual proteins, but by groups of functionally associated proteins, often referred to as modules. In a protein assocation network modules appear as groups of densely interconnected nodes, also called communities or clusters. These modules often overlap with each other and form a network of their own, in which nodes (links) represent the modules (overlaps). We introduce CFinder, a fast program locating and visualizing overlapping, densely interconnected groups of nodes in undirected graphs, and allowing the user to easily navigate between the original graph and the web of these groups. We show that in gene (protein) association networks CFinder can be used to predict the function(s) of a single protein and to discover novel modules. CFinder is also very efficient for locating the cliques of large sparse graphs.

We give a careful theoretical characterization of the set of seeds (i.e., some maximal exact repeats) required by the algorithm, and prove a sublinear bound on their expected numbers. Using this result, we present a sub-quadratic algorithm for finding all short (i.e., of length O(log N)) approximate repeats. The running time of our algorithm is O(DN3pow(\{epsilon\})-1log N), where \{epsilon\} = D/P and pow(\{epsilon\}) is an increasing, concave function that is 0 when \{epsilon\} = 0 and about 0.9 for DNA and protein sequences.

This review surveys the recent advances in the field of graph-driven methods for analysing complex cellular networks. The methods are outlined on three levels of increasing complexity, ranging from methods that can characterize global or local structural properties of networks to methods that can detect groups of interconnected nodes, called motifs or clusters, potentially involved in common elementary biological functions. We also briefly summarize recent approaches to data integration and network inference through graph-based formalisms. Finally, we highlight some challenges in the field and offer our personal view of the key future trends and developments in graph-based analysis of large-scale datasets.},

  Abstract                 = {Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been extensively studied and have shown remarkable success in many applications. However the success of SVM is very limited when it is applied to the problem of learning from imbalanced datasets in which negative instances heavily outnumber the positive instances (e.g. in gene profiling and detecting credit card fraud). This paper discusses the factors behind this failure and explains why the common strategy of undersampling the training data may not be the best choice for SVM. We then propose an algorithm for overcoming these problems which is based on a variant of the SMOTE algorithm by Chawla et al, combined with Veropoulos et alâ€™s different error costs algorithm. We compare the performance of our algorithm against these two algorithms, along with undersampling and regular SVM and show that our algorithm outperforms all of them.},

A significant proportion of the genes missed by the system appear to be hypothetical proteins whose existence is only supported by the predictions of other programs. When the analysis is restricted to genes that have significant homology to genes in other organisms, GLIMMER misses <1\% of known genes. },

We find that the anomalous scaling index is compatible with a simple dynamical model, a random walk on a complex scale-free network, which is linguistically related to Saussurre's paradigms. The network complexity is independently measured on the same corpus, looking at the co-occurrence of nouns and verbs. This connection of cognitive complexity with long-range time correlations also provides an explanation for the famous Zipf's law in terms of the generalized central limit theorem.

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:After complete sequencing of a number of genomes the focus has now turned to proteomics. Advanced proteomics technologies such as two-hybrid assay, mass spectrometry etc. are producing huge data sets of protein-protein interactions which can be portrayed as networks, and one of the burning issues is to find protein complexes in such networks. The enormous size of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks warrants development of efficient computational methods for extraction of significant complexes.RESULTS:This paper presents an algorithm for detection of protein complexes in large interaction networks. In a PPI network, a node represents a protein and an edge represents an interaction. The input to the algorithm is the associated matrix of an interaction network and the outputs are protein complexes. The complexes are determined by way of finding clusters, i. e. the densely connected regions in the network. We also show and analyze some protein complexes generated by the proposed algorithm from typical PPI networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A comparison between a PPI and a random network is also performed in the context of the proposed algorithm.CONCLUSION:The proposed algorithm makes it possible to detect clusters of proteins in PPI networks which mostly represent molecular biological functional units. Therefore, protein complexes determined solely based on interaction data can help us to predict the functions of proteins, and they are also useful to understand and explain certain biological processes.},

In order to retain and convey such a high dimensional information, the statistical properties of our linguistic output has to be highly correlated in time. An example are the robust observations, still largely not understood, of correlations on arbitrary long scales in literary texts. In this paper we explain how long-range correlations flow from highly structured linguistic levels down to the building blocks of a text (words, letters, etc..). By combining calculations and data analysis we show that correlations take form of a bursty sequence of events once we approach the semantically relevant topics of the text. The mechanisms we identify are fairly general and can be equally applied to other hierarchical settings.},

Even more dynamic are the short-term fluctuations in word usage by individuals in a population. Building on the recent demonstration that word niche is a strong determinant of future rise or fall in word frequency, here we introduce a model that allows us to distinguish persistent from temporary increases in frequency. Our model is illustrated using a 10\^{}8-word database from an online discussion group and a 10\^{}11-word collection of digitized books. The model reveals a strong relation between changes in word dissemination and changes in frequency. Aside from their implications for short-term word frequency dynamics, these observations are potentially important for language evolution as new words must survive in the short term in order to survive in the long term.},

  Abstract                 = {Thoughts and ideas are multidimensional and often concurrent, yet they can be expressed surprisingly well sequentially by the translation into language. This reduction of dimensions occurs naturally but requires memory and necessitates the existence of correlations, e.g., in written text. However, correlations in word appearance decay quickly, while previous observations of long-range correlations using random walk approaches yield little insight on memory or on semantic context. Instead, we study combinations of words that a reader is exposed to within a "window of attention," spanning about 100 words. We define a vector space of such word combinations by looking at words that co-occur within the window of attention, and analyze its structure. Singular value decomposition of the co-occurrence matrix identifies a basis whose vectors correspond to specific topics, or "concepts" that are relevant to the text. As the reader follows a text, the "vector of attention" traces out a trajectory of directions in this "concept space." We find that memory of the direction is retained over long times, forming power-law correlations. The appearance of power laws hints at the existence of an underlying hierarchical network. Indeed, imposing a hierarchy similar to that defined by volumes, chapters, paragraphs, etc. succeeds in creating correlations in a surrogate random text that are identical to those of the original text. We conclude that hierarchical structures in text serve to create long-range correlations, and use the reader's memory in reenacting some of the multidimensionality of the thoughts being expressed.},

  Abstract                 = {The behavior of rank-ordered distributions of phenomena present in a variety of fields such as biology, sociology, linguistics, finance and geophysics has been a matter of intense research. Often power laws have been encountered; however, their validity tends to hold mainly for an intermediate range of rank values. In a recent publication (Mart\'{\i}nez-Mekler et al., 2009 [7]), a generalization of the functional form of the beta distribution has been shown to give excellent fits for many systems of very diverse nature, valid for the whole range of rank values, regardless of whether or not a power law behavior has been previously suggested. Here we give some insight on the significance of the two free parameters which appear as exponents in the functional form, by looking into discrete probabilistic branching processes with conflicting dynamics. We analyze a variety of realizations of these so-called expansionâ€“modification models first introduced by Wentian Li (1989) [10]. We focus our attention on an orderâ€“disorder transition we encounter as we vary the modification probability p. We characterize this transition by means of the fitting parameters. Our numerical studies show that one of the fitting exponents is related to the presence of long-range correlations exhibited by power spectrum scale invariance, while the other registers the effect of disordering elements leading to a breakdown of these properties. In the absence of long-range correlations, this parameter is sensitive to the occurrence of unlikely events. We also introduce an approximate calculation scheme that relates this dynamics to multinomial multiplicative processes. A better understanding through these models of the meaning of the generalized beta-fitting exponents may contribute to their potential for identifying and characterizing universality classes.},

  Abstract                 = {While the use of statistical physics methods to analyze large corpora has been useful to unveil many patterns in texts, no comprehensive investigation has been performed investigating the properties of statistical measurements across different languages and texts. In this study we propose a framework that aims at determining if a text is compatible with a natural language and which languages are closest to it, without any knowledge of the meaning of the words. The approach is based on three types of statistical measurements, i.e. obtained from first-order statistics of word properties in a text, from the topology of complex networks representing text, and from intermittency concepts where text is treated as a time series. Comparative experiments were performed with the New Testament in 15 different languages and with distinct books in English and Portuguese in order to quantify the dependency of the different measurements on the language and on the story being told in the book. The metrics found to be informative in distinguishing real texts from their shuffled versions include assortativity, degree and selectivity of words. As an illustration, we analyze an undeciphered medieval manuscript known as the Voynich Manuscript. We show that it is mostly compatible with natural languages and incompatible with random texts. We also obtain candidates for key-words of the Voynich Manuscript which could be helpful in the effort of deciphering it. Because we were able to identify statistical measurements that are more dependent on the syntax than on the semantics, the framework may also serve for text analysis in language-dependent applications.},

With the completion of a finished genome sequence we must now functionally characterize the rice genome by a variety of methods, including comparative genomic analysis between cereal species and within the genus contains two cultivated and 22 wild species that represent 10 distinct genome types. The wild species contain an essentially untapped reservoir of agriculturally important genes that must be harnessed if we are to maintain a safe and secure food supply for the 21st century. As a first step to functionally characterize the rice genome from a comparative standpoint, we report the construction and analysis of a comprehensive set of 12 BAC libraries that represent the 10 genome types of . To estimate the number of clones required to generate 10 genome equivalent BAC libraries we determined the genome sizes of nine of the 12 species using flow cytometry. Each library represents a minimum of 10 genome equivalents, has an average insert size range between 123 and 161 kb, an average organellar content of 0.4\%\^{a}â‚¬â€œ4.1\% and nonrecombinant content between 0\% and 5\%. Genome coverage was estimated mathematically and empirically by hybridization and extensive contig and BAC end sequence analysis. A preliminary analysis of BAC end sequences of clones from these libraries indicated that LTR retrotransposons are the predominant class of repeat elements in and a roughly linear relationship of these elements with genome size was observed.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Transposable elements (TE) are mobile genetic entities present in nearly all genomes. Previous work has shown that TEs tend to have a different nucleotide composition than the host genes, either considering codon usage bias or dinucleotide frequencies. We show here how these compositional differences can be used as a tool for detection and analysis of TE sequences.RESULTS:We compared the composition of TE sequences and host gene sequences using probabilistic models of nucleotide sequences. We used hidden Markov models (HMM), which take into account the base composition of the sequences (occurrences of words n nucleotides long, with n ranging here from 1 to 4) and the heterogeneity between coding and non-coding parts of sequences. We analyzed three sets of sequences containing class I TEs, class II TEs and genes respectively in three species: Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and Arabidopsis thaliana. Each of these sets had a distinct, homogeneous composition, enabling us to distinguish between the two classes of TE and the genes. However the particular base composition of the TEs differed in the three species studied.CONCLUSIONS:This approach can be used to detect and annotate TEs in genomic sequences and complements the current homology-based TE detection methods. Furthermore, the HMM method is able to identify the parts of a sequence in which the nucleotide composition resembles that of a coding region of a TE. This is useful for the detailed annotation of TE sequences, which may contain an ancient, highly diverged coding region that is no longer fully functional.},

  Abstract                 = {Some disciplines in the social sciences rely heavily on collecting survey responses to detect empirical relationships among variables. We explored whether these relationships were a priori predictable from the semantic properties of the survey items, using language processing algorithms which are now available as new research methods. Language processing algorithms were used to calculate the semantic similarity among all items in state-of-the-art surveys from Organisational Behaviour research. These surveys covered areas such as transformational leadership, work motivation and work outcomes. This information was used to explain and predict the response patterns from real subjects. Semantic algorithms explained 60-86\% of the variance in the response patterns and allowed remarkably precise prediction of survey responses from humans, except in a personality test. Even the relationships between independent and their purported dependent variables were accurately predicted. This raises concern about the empirical nature of data collected through some surveys if results are already given a priori through the way subjects are being asked. Survey response patterns seem heavily determined by semantics. Language algorithms may suggest these prior to administering a survey. This study suggests that semantic algorithms are becoming new tools for the social sciences, opening perspectives on survey responses that prevalent psychometric theory cannot explain.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Unsupervised annotation of proteins by software pipelines suffers from very high error rates. Spurious functional assignments are usually caused by unwarranted homology-based transfer of information from existing database entries to the new target sequences. We have previously demonstrated that data mining in large sequence annotation databanks can help identify annotation items that are strongly associated with each other, and that exceptions from strong positive association rules often point to potential annotation errors. Here we investigate the applicability of negative association rule mining to revealing erroneously assigned annotation items.RESULTS:Almost all exceptions from strong negative association rules are connected to at least one wrong attribute in the feature combination making up the rule. The fraction of annotation features flagged by this approach as suspicious is strongly enriched in errors and constitutes about 0.6\% of the whole body of the similarity-transferred annotation in the PEDANT genome database. Positive rule mining does not identify two thirds of these errors. The approach based on exceptions from negative rules is much more specific than positive rule mining, but its coverage is significantly lower.CONCLUSION:Mining of both negative and positive association rules is a potent tool for finding significant trends in protein annotation and flagging doubtful features for further inspection.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Millions of protein sequences currently being deposited to sequence databanks will never be annotated manually. Similarity-based annotation generated by automatic software pipelines unavoidably contains spurious assignments due to the imperfection of bioinformatics methods. Examples of such annotation errors include over- and underpredictions caused by the use of fixed recognition thresholds and incorrect annotations caused by transitivity based information transfer to unrelated proteins or transfer of errors already accumulated in databases. One of the most difficult and timely challenges in bioinformatics is the development of intelligent systems aimed at improving the quality of automatically generated annotation. A possible approach to this problem is to detect anomalies in annotation items based on association rule mining. Results: We present the first large-scale analysis of association rules derived from two large protein annotation databases--Swiss-Prot and PEDANT--and reveal novel, previously unknown tendencies of rule strength distributions. Most of the rules are either very strong or very weak, with rules in the medium strength range being relatively infrequent. Based on dynamics of error correction in subsequent Swiss-Prot releases and on our own manual analysis we demonstrate that exceptions from strong rules are, indeed, significantly enriched in annotation errors and can be used to automatically flag them. We identify different strength dependencies of rules derived from different fields in Swiss-Prot. A compositional breakdown of association rules generated from PEDANT in terms of their constituent items indicates that most of the errors that can be corrected are related to gene functional roles. Swiss-Prot errors are usually caused by under-annotation owing to its conservative approach, whereas automatically generated PEDANT annotation suffers from over-annotation.

  Abstract                 = {In several plant systems expression of structurally intact genes may be silenced epigenetically when a transgenic construct increases the copy number of DNA sequences. Here we report epigenetic silencing inArabidopsis lines containing transgenic inserts of defined genetic structure, all at the same genomic locus. These comprise an allelic series that includes a single copy of the primary insert, which carries repeated drug resistance transgenes, and a set of its derivatives, which as a result of recombination within the insert carry different numbers and alleles of resistance genes. Although the drug resistance genes remained intact, both the primary and some recombinant lines nevertheless segregated many progeny that were partly or fully drug-sensitive because of silencing. As in other systems silencing was reversible, and correlated with decreased steady-state mRNA and increased DNA methylation. Each different number and combination of genes, on the same or different (i.e., homologous) chromosomes, conditioned its own idiosyncratic segregation pattern. Strikingly, lines with a single gene segregated only a few slightly drug-sensitive progeny whereas multi-gene lines segregated many highly sensitive progeny, indicating dependence of silencing at this locus on repeated sequences. This argues strongly against explanations based on antisense RNA, but is consistent with explanations based on ectopic DNA pairing. One possibility is that silencing reflects the interaction of paired homologous DNA with flanking heterologous DNA, which induces condensation of chromatin into a non-transcribable state.},

  Abstract                 = {Classification is an important topic in data mining research. It is concerned with the prediction of the values of some attribute in a database based on other attributes. To tackle this problem, most of the existing data mining algorithms adopt either a decision tree based approach or an approach that requires users to provide some user-specified thresholds to guide the search for interesting rules. The authors propose a new approach based on the use of an objective interestingness measure to distinguish interesting rules from uninteresting ones. Using linguistic terms to represent the revealed regularities and exceptions, this approach is especially useful when the discovered rules are presented to human experts for examination because of the affinity with the human knowledge representation. The use of a fuzzy technique allows the prediction of attribute values to be associated with degree of membership. Our approach is therefore able to deal with the cases where an object can belong to more than one class. Furthermore, our approach is more resilient to noise and missing data values because of the use of a fuzzy technique. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we tested it using several real-life databases. The experimental results show that it can be very effective at data mining tasks. When compared to popular data mining algorithms, the approach is better able to uncover useful rules hidden in databases},

Their corresponding shuffled versions are used for obtaining a "base line". Two different one-dimensional time series are used here: (i) one based on word lengths (LTS), (ii) the other on word frequencies (FTS). It is shown that the generalized Hurst exponent \$h(q)\$ and the derived \$f(\backslash alpha)\$ curves of the original and translated texts show marked differences. The original "texts" are far from giving a parabolic \$f(\backslash alpha)\$ function, - in contrast to the shuffled texts. Moreover, the Esperanto text has more extreme values. This suggests cascade model-like, with multiscale time asymmetric features as finally written texts. A discussion of the difference and complementarity of mapping into a LTS or FTS is presented. The FTS \$f(\backslash alpha)\$ curves are more opened than the LTS ones},

  Abstract                 = {Should quality be almost a synonymous of complexity? To measure quality appears to be audacious, even very subjective. It is hereby proposed to use a multifractal approach in order to quantify quality, thus through complexity measures. A one-dimensional system is examined. It is known that (all) written texts can be one-dimensional nonlinear maps. Thus, several written texts by the same author are considered, together with their translation, into an unusual language, Esperanto, and asa baseline their corresponding shuffled versions. Different one-dimensional time series can be used: e.g. (i) one based on word lengths, (ii) the other based on word frequencies; both are used for studying, comparing and discussing the map structure. It is shown that a variety in style can be measured through the D(q) and f($\alpha$) curves characterizing multifractal objects. This allows to observe on the one hand whether natural and artificial languages significantly influence the writing and the translation, and whether one authorâ€™s texts differ technically from each other. In fact, the f($\alpha$) curves of the original texts are similar to each other, but the translated text shows marked differences. However in each case, the f($\alpha$) curves are far from being parabolic, â€“ in contrast to the shuffled texts. Moreover, the Esperanto text has more extreme values. Criteria are thereby suggested for estimating a text quality, as if it is a time series only. A model is introduced in order to substantiate the findings: it consists in considering a text as a random Cantor set resulting from a binomial cascade of long and short words with appropriate weights. In an appendix, a connection is given with an analysis of turbulence by statistics based on Tsallis generalized entropy. In a second appendix, another view of text (language) complexity is outlined within the copying mistake map concept.},

  Abstract                 = {A comparison of two english texts from Lewis Carroll, one (Alice in wonderland), also translated into esperanto, the other (Through a looking glass) are discussed in order to observe whether natural and artificial languages significantly differ from each other. One dimensional time series like signals are constructed using only word frequencies (FTS) or word lengths (LTS). The data is studied through (i) a Zipf method for sorting out correlations in the FTS and (ii) a Grassberger-Procaccia (GP) technique based method for finding correlations in LTS. Features are compared : different power laws are observed with characteristic exponents for the ranking properties, and the \{$\backslash$it phase space attractor dimensionality\}. The Zipf exponent can take values much less than unity (\$ca.\$ 0.50 or 0.30) depending on how a sentence is defined. This non-universality is conjectured to be a measure of the author \$style\$. Moreover the attractor dimension \$r\$ is a simple function of the so called phase space dimension \$n\$, i.e., \$r = n\^{}\{\backslash lambda\}\$, with \$\backslash lambda = 0.79\$. Such an exponent should also conjecture to be a measure of the author \$creativity\$. However, even though there are quantitative differences between the original english text and its esperanto translation, the qualitative differences are very minutes, indicating in this case a translation relatively well respecting, along our analysis lines, the content of the author writing.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Recent advances in proteomics technologies such as two-hybrid, phage display and mass spectrometry have enabled us to create a detailed map of biomolecular interaction networks. Initial mapping efforts have already produced a wealth of data. As the size of the interaction set increases, databases and computational methods will be required to store, visualize and analyze the information in order to effectively aid in knowledge discovery.RESULTS:This paper describes a novel graph theoretic clustering algorithm, "Molecular Complex Detection" (MCODE), that detects densely connected regions in large protein-protein interaction networks that may represent molecular complexes. The method is based on vertex weighting by local neighborhood density and outward traversal from a locally dense seed protein to isolate the dense regions according to given parameters. The algorithm has the advantage over other graph clustering methods of having a directed mode that allows fine-tuning of clusters of interest without considering the rest of the network and allows examination of cluster interconnectivity, which is relevant for protein networks. Protein interaction and complex information from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used for evaluation.CONCLUSION:Dense regions of protein interaction networks can be found, based solely on connectivity data, many of which correspond to known protein complexes. The algorithm is not affected by a known high rate of false positives in data from high-throughput interaction techniques. The program is available from ftp://ftp.mshri.on.ca/pub/BIND/Tools/MCODE.},

  Abstract                 = {It is well-known that word frequencies arrange themselves according to Zipf's law. However, little is known about the dependency of the parameters of the law and the complexity of a communication system. Many models of the evolution of language assume that the exponent of the law remains constant as the complexity of a communication systems increases. Using longitudinal studies of child language, we analysed the word rank distribution for the speech of children and adults participating in conversations. The adults typically included family members (e.g., parents) or the investigators conducting the research. Our analysis of the evolution of Zipf's law yields two main unexpected results. First, in children the exponent of the law tends to decrease over time while this tendency is weaker in adults, thus suggesting this is not a mere mirror effect of adult speech. Second, although the exponent of the law is more stable in adults, their exponents fall below 1 which is the typical value of the exponent assumed in both children and adults. Our analysis also shows a tendency of the mean length of utterances (MLU), a simple estimate of syntactic complexity, to increase as the exponent decreases. The parallel evolution of the exponent and a simple indicator of syntactic complexity (MLU) supports the hypothesis that the exponent of Zipf's law and linguistic complexity are inter-related. The assumption that Zipf's law for word ranks is a power-law with a constant exponent of one in both adults and children needs to be revised.},

  Abstract                 = {The relationship between the size of the whole and the size of the parts in language and music is known to follow Menzerath-Altmann law at many levels of description (morphemes, words, sentences...). Qualitatively, the law states that larger the whole, the smaller its parts, e.g., the longer a word (in syllables) the shorter its syllables (in letters or phonemes). This patterning has also been found in genomes: the longer a genome (in chromosomes), the shorter its chromosomes (in base pairs). However, it has been argued recently that mean chromosome length is trivially a pure power function of chromosome number with an exponent of -1. The functional dependency between mean chromosome size and chromosome number in groups of organisms from three different kingdoms is studied. The fit of a pure power function yields exponents between -1.6 and 0.1. It is shown that an exponent of -1 is unlikely for fungi, gymnosperm plants, insects, reptiles, ray-finned fishes and amphibians. Even when the exponent is very close to -1, adding an exponential component is able to yield a better fit with regard to a pure power-law to plants, mammals, ray-finned fishes and amphibians. The parameters of Menzerath-Altmann law in genomes deviate significantly from a power law with a -1 exponent with the exception of birds and cartilaginous fishes.},

  Abstract                 = {During the past several years, social network analysis methods have been used to model many complex real-world phenomena, including social networks, transportation networks, and the Internet. Graph theoretic methods, based on an elegant representation of entities and relationships, have been used in computational biology to study biological networks; however they have not yet been adopted widely by the greater informatics community. The graphs produced are generally large, sparse, and complex, and share common global topological properties. In this review of research (1998-2005) on large-scale semantic networks, we used a tailored search strategy to identify articles involving both a graph theoretic perspective and semantic information. Thirty-one relevant articles were retrieved. The majority (28, 90.3\%) involved an investigation of a real-world network. These included corpora, thesauri, dictionaries, large computer programs, biological neuronal networks, word association networks, and files on the Internet. Twenty-two of the 28 (78.6\%) involved a graph comprised of words or phrases. Fifteen of the 28 (53.6\%) mentioned evidence of small-world characteristics in the network investigated. Eleven (39.3\%) reported a scale-free topology, which tends to have a similar appearance when examined at varying scales. The results of this review indicate that networks generated from natural language have topological properties common to other natural phenomena. It has not yet been determined whether artificial human-curated terminology systems in biomedicine share these properties. Large network analysis methods have potential application in a variety of areas of informatics, such as in development of controlled vocabularies and for characterizing a given domain.},

However, for most language pairs, translation via an intermediate language is necessary. Two distinct methods for dealing with the additional ambiguity introduced by the extra translation step have been proposed and individually, shown to improve retrieval effectiveness. Two previous works indicated that in combination, the methods were ineffective. This paper provides strong empirical evidence that the methods can be combined to produce consistent and often significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness. The improvement is shown across a number of different intermediate languages and test collections.},

Observing that the quality of the lexicon greatly impacts the accuracy that can be achieved by the algorithms, we present a method of HMM training that improves accuracy when training of lexical probabilities is unstable. Finally, we show how this new tagger achieves state-of-the-art results in a supervised, non-training intensive framework.},

Shifting to a new domain requires the user to name the target relations and to manually create new extraction rules or hand-tag new training examples. This manual labor scales linearly with the number of target relations. This paper introduces Open IE (OIE), a new ex- traction paradigmwhere the system makes a single data-driven pass over its corpus and extracts a large set of relational tupleswithout requiring any human input. The paper also introduces TEXTRUNNER, a fully implemented, highly scalable OIE system where the tuples are assigned a probability and indexed to support efficient extraction and explo- ration via user queries. We report on experiments over a 9,000,000 Web page corpus that compare TEXTRUNNER with KNOWITALL, a state-of-the-art Web IE system. TEXTRUNNER achieves an error reduction of 33\% on a comparable set of extractions. Furthermore, in the amount of time it takes KNOWITALL to per- form extraction for a handful of pre-specified re- lations, TEXTRUNNER extracts a far broader set of facts reflecting orders of magnitude more rela- tions, discovered on the fly. We report statistics on TEXTRUNNERâ€™s 11,000,000 highest probability tuples, and show that they contain over 1,000,000 concrete facts and over 6,500,000more abstract as- sertions. 1},

Our extensions use multiple alignment information to define the boundaries of individual copies of the repeats and to distinguish homologous but distinct repeat element families. When tested on the human genome, our approach was able to properly identify and group known transposable elements. The program, RECON, should be useful for first-pass automatic classification of repeats in newly sequenced genomes.},

  Abstract                 = {Information and communications technologies are becoming increasingly diffused within the material spaces of the city, generating novel ways of representing complex, hitherto â€˜invisibleâ€™ urban behaviours in real-time. Many digital urbanists are inspired by the capacity of these network technologies to radically transform our perceptions and experiences of urban space. But how â€˜newâ€™, really, is this emergent vision of the city? This is a thesis about the potentials of the real-time city. However, unlike many existing studies, the focus is less on the technologies of urban computing and the new modes of interactivity they enable, and more on the underlying conception of â€˜the cityâ€™ advanced here. A central argument is that we need to be mindful of the utopian vision that digital urbanists espouse when they make claims about the potentials of real-time systems to change the way we view cities. Establishing the contemporary vision of the real-time city as a particular, and highly contested, way of imagining the space of the city, my thesis retrieves some different practices and perspectives, drawn from the fields of critical spatial theory, cultural geography and sound studies, to re-imagine a â€˜real-timeâ€™ experience of the urban terrain. Through a practice-led response, I offer a sense of the digital terrain as a historical topology that enfolds within it different time-spaces â€“ the â€˜real times of spaceâ€™ â€“ lingering in the back-alleys of the contemporary scene. My practice makes tactical use of the mobile device as a listening platform, capable of retrieving the substrata of todayâ€™s digital terrain through its archival audio traces. Working in Sydney, Australia, Iâ€™ve retrieved the ambient resonances of particular moments in the life of the city in the way one might navigate a memori topi, using archival sound traces to facilitate experiential audio-visual interactions with the past-presences of an urban space. This is a trans-disciplinary project, which engages different spatial imaginaries of the city present within fields such as digital urbanism, cultural geography, sound history, utopian studies and urban planning. By sounding out the resonant traces of past moments, I hope to enrich our spatial imaginary of the real-time city and its digital practices; to not only illuminate the contours of its networked connectivity, but to also listen, and learn, from what we might retrieve when we return to its forgotten spaces.},

  Abstract                 = {In contrast with animal communication systems, diversity is characteristic of almost every aspect of human language. Languages variously employ tones, clicks, or manual signs to signal differences in meaning; some languages lack the noun-verb distinction (e.g., Straits Salish), whereas others have a proliferation of fine-grained syntactic categories (e.g., Tzeltal); and some languages do without morphology (e.g., Mandarin), while others pack a whole sentence into a single word (e.g., Cayuga). A challenge for evolutionary biology is to reconcile the diversity of languages with the high degree of biological uniformity of their speakers. Here, we model processes of language change and geographical dispersion and find a consistent pressure for flexible learning, irrespective of the language being spoken. This pressure arises because flexible learners can best cope with the observed high rates of linguistic change associated with divergent cultural evolution following human migration. Thus, rather than genetic adaptations for specific aspects of language, such as recursion, the coevolution of genes and fast-changing linguistic structure provides the biological basis for linguistic diversity. Only biological adaptations for flexible learning combined with cultural evolution can explain how each child has the potential to learn any human language.},

Recently, however, a new Network Science has been developed, providing insights into the emergence of global, system-scale properties in contexts as diverse as the Internet, metabolic reactions, and collaborations among scientists. Today, the inclusion of network theory into Cognitive Sciences, and the expansion of complex-systems science, promises to significantly change the way in which the organization and dynamics of cognitive and behavioral processes are understood.

  Abstract                 = {The empirical evidence that human color categorization exhibits some universal patterns beyond superficial discrepancies across different cultures is a major breakthrough in cognitive science. As observed in the World Color Survey (WCS), indeed, any two groups of individuals develop quite different categorization patterns, but some universal properties can be identified by a statistical analysis over a large number of populations. Here, we reproduce the WCS in a numerical model in which different populations develop independently their own categorization systems by playing elementary language games. We find that a simple perceptual constraint shared by all humans, namely the human Just Noticeable Difference (JND), is sufficient to trigger the emergence of universal patterns that unconstrained cultural interaction fails to produce. We test the results of our experiment against real data by performing the same statistical analysis proposed to quantify the universal tendencies shown in the WCS [Kay P \& Regier T. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100: 9085-9089], and obtain an excellent quantitative agreement. This work confirms that synthetic modeling has nowadays reached the maturity to contribute significantly to the ongoing debate in cognitive science.},

This paper first reviews some existing results and then presents a new overall understanding.},

  Abstract                 = {We review the behavior of a recently introduced model of agreement dynamics, called the "Naming Game." This model describes the self-organized emergence of linguistic conventions and the establishment of simple communication systems in a population of agents with pairwise local interactions. The mechanisms of convergence towards agreement strongly depend on the network of possible interactions between the agents. In particular, the mean-field case in which all agents communicate with all the others is not efficient, since a large temporary memory is requested for the agents. On the other hand, regular lattice topologies lead to a fast local convergence but to a slow global dynamics similar to coarsening phenomena. The embedding of the agents in a small-world network represents an interesting tradeoff: a local consensus is easily reached, while the long-range links allow to bypass coarsening-like convergence. We also consider alternative adaptive strategies which can lead to faster global convergence.},

  Abstract                 = {Determining phylogenetic relationships between species is a difficult problem, and many phylogenetic relationships remain unresolved, even among eutherian mammals. Repetitive elements provide excellent markers for phylogenetic analysis, because their mode of evolution is predominantly homoplasy-free and unidirectional. Historically, phylogenetic studies using repetitive elements have relied on biological methods such as PCR analysis, and computational inference is limited to a few isolated repeats. Here, we present a novel computational method for inferring phylogenetic relationships from partial sequence data using orthologous repeats. We apply our method to reconstructing the phylogeny of 28 mammals, using more than 1000 orthologous repeats obtained from sequence data available from the NISC Comparative Sequencing Program. The resulting phylogeny has robust bootstrap numbers, and broadly matches results from previous studies which were obtained using entirely different data and methods. In addition, we shed light on some of the debatable aspects of the phylogeny. With rapid expansion of available partial sequence data, computational analysis of repetitive elements holds great promise for the future of phylogenetic inference.},

These words are then used to transmit information to other neurons in the form of phrases consisting of two or more words that are contained within longer pause-delineated structured declarative sentences. In this article, the nature of neuronal words and language are described, and exam-ples provided that illustrate the way in which neuronal language is used by the brain to in-teract with and interpret both its internal and external environments. It is hoped that a fuller understanding of the language used by neurons to communicate may lead to development of novel treatments for a number of human neu-ropathies.},

Even in the absence of previous biological knowledge, it should identify sets of genes whose expression is correlated. The first association-rule miners appeared six years ago and proved efficient at dealing with sparse and weakly correlated data. A huge international research effort has led to new algorithms for tackling difficult contexts and these are particularly suited to analysis of large gene-expression matrices. To validate the ARD technique we have applied it to freely available human serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) data.RESULTS:The approach described here enables us to designate sets of strong association rules. We normalized the SAGE data before applying our association rule miner. Depending on the discretization algorithm used, different properties of the data were highlighted. Both common and specific interpretations could be made from the extracted rules. In each and every case the extracted collections of rules indicated that a very strong co-regulation of mRNA encoding ribosomal proteins occurs in the dataset. Several rules associating proteins involved in signal transduction were obtained and analyzed, some pointing to yet-unexplored directions. Furthermore, by examining a subset of these rules, we were able both to reassign a wrongly labeled tag, and to propose a function for an expressed sequence tag encoding a protein of unknown function.CONCLUSIONS:We show that ARD is a promising technique that turns out to be complementary to existing gene-expression clustering techniques.},

In this paper, we exploit one of this possibility, by investigating how to detect the user motion type through sensors data collected by a smartphone. Our study combines experimental and analytical contributions, and it is structured in three parts. First, we collected experimental data that demonstrate the existence of specific sensors data patterns associated to each motion type, and we propose methods for data analysis and features extraction. Second, we compare the performance of different supervised algorithms for motion type classification, and we demonstrate that jointly utilizing the multiple sensor inputs of a smartphone (i.e. the accelerometer and the gyroscope) can significantly improve the accuracy of the classifiers. At the same time, we analyze the impact of sampling parameters (e.g. the sampling rate) on the system performance, and the corresponding trade- off between classification accuracy and energy consumption of the device. Third, we integrate the motion type recognition algorithm into an Android application, that allows to associate a specific smartphone configuration to each detected motion type, and to provide this information at system-level to other context- aware Android applications. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of our application in detecting the userâ€™s motion type with high accuracy, and in mitigating the classification errors caused by random data fluctuations.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Characterization of a protein family by its distinct sequence domains is crucial for functional annotation and correct classification of newly discovered proteins. Conventional Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) based methods find difficulties when faced with heterogeneous groups of proteins. However, even many families of proteins that do share a common domain contain instances of several other domains, without any common underlying linear ordering. Ignoring this modularity may lead to poor or even false classification results. An automated method that can analyze a group of proteins into the sequence domains it contains is therefore highly desirable. Results: We apply a novel method to the problem of protein domain detection. The method takes as input an unaligned group of protein sequences. It segments them and clusters the segments into groups sharing the same underlying statistics. A Variable Memory Markov (VMM) model is built using a Prediction Suffix Tree (PST) data structure for each group of segments. Refinement is achieved by letting the PSTs compete over the segments, and a deterministic annealing framework infers the number of underlying PST models while avoiding many inferior solutions. We show that regions of similar statistics correlate well with protein sequence domains, by matching a unique signature to each domain. This is done in a fully automated manner, and does not require or attempt an MSA. Several representative cases are analyzed. We identify a protein fusion event, refine an HMM superfamily classification into the underlying families the HMM cannot separate, and detect all 12 instances of a short domain in a group of 396 sequences.

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: We present a method for modeling protein families by means of probabilistic suffix trees (PSTs). The method is based on identifying significant patterns in a set of related protein sequences. The patterns can be of arbitrary length, and the input sequences do not need to be aligned, nor is delineation of domain boundaries required. The method is automatic, and can be applied, without assuming any preliminary biological information, with surprising success. Basic biological considerations such as amino acid background probabilities, and amino acids substitution probabilities can be incorporated to improve performance. Results: The PST can serve as a predictive tool for protein sequence classification, and for detecting conserved patterns (possibly functionally or structurally important) within protein sequences. The method was tested on the Pfam database of protein families with more than satisfactory performance. Exhaustive evaluations show that the PST model detects much more related sequences than pairwise methods such as Gapped-BLAST, and is almost as sensitive as a hidden Markov model that is trained from a multiple alignment of the input sequences, while being much faster.

  Abstract                 = {Retroviral LTRs, paired or single, influence the transcription of both retroviral and non-retroviral genomic sequences. Vertebrate genomes contain many thousand endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and their LTRs. Single LTRs are difficult to detect from genomic sequences without recourse to repetitiveness or presence in a proviral structure. Understanding of LTR structure increases understanding of LTR function, and of functional genomics. Here we develop models of orthoretroviral LTRs useful for detection in genomes and for structural analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {Transposable elements were first discovered in plants because they can have tremendous effects on genome structure and gene function. Although only a few or no elements may be active within a genome at any time in any individual, the genomic alterations they cause can have major outcomes for a species. All major element types appear to be present in all plant species, but their quantitative and qualitative contributions are enormously variable even between closely related lineages. In some large-genome plants, mobile DNAs make up the majority of the nuclear genome. They can rearrange genomes and alter individual gene structure and regulation through any of the activities they promote: transposition, insertion, excision, chromosome breakage, and ectopic recombination. Many genes may have been assembled or amplified through the action of transposable elements, and it is likely that most plant genes contain legacies of multiple transposable element insertions into promoters. Because chromosomal rearrangements can lead to speciating infertility in heterozygous progeny, transposable elements may be responsible for the rate at which such incompatibility is generated in separated populations. For these reasons, understanding plant gene and genome evolution is only possible if we comprehend the contributions of transposable elements.},

  Abstract                 = {It is well known that natural languages share certain aspects of their design. For example, across languages, syllables like blif are preferred to lbif. But whether language universals are myths or mentally active constraints-linguistic or otherwise-remains controversial. To address this question, we used fMRI to investigate brain response to four syllable types, arrayed on their linguistic well-formedness (e.g., blifâ‰»bnifâ‰»bdifâ‰»lbif, where â‰» indicates preference). Results showed that syllable structure monotonically modulated hemodynamic response in Broca's area, and its pattern mirrored participants' behavioral preferences. In contrast, ill-formed syllables did not systematically tax sensorimotor regions-while such syllables engaged primary auditory cortex, they tended to deactivate (rather than engage) articulatory motor regions. The convergence between the cross-linguistic preferences and English participants' hemodynamic and behavioral responses is remarkable given that most of these syllables are unattested in their language. We conclude that human brains encode broad restrictions on syllable structure.},

Here we review the diversity of innovative approaches to identify and annotate TEs in the post-genomic era, covering both the discovery of new TE families and the detection of individual TE copies in genome sequences. These approaches span a broad spectrum in computational biology including de novo, homology-based, structure-based and comparative genomic methods. We conclude that the integration and visualization of multiple approaches and the development of new conceptual representations for TE annotation will further advance the computational analysis of this dynamic component of the genome.},

We compare the statistics of the word distribution for a monkey book with the corresponding distribution for the general class of random books, where the latter are books for which the words are randomly distributed. It is shown that the word distribution statistics for the monkey book is different and quite distinct from a typical sampled book or real book. In particular the monkey book obeys Heaps' power law to an extraordinary good approximation, in contrast to the word distributions for sampled and real books, which deviate from Heaps' law in a characteristics way. The somewhat counter-intuitive conclusion is that a "monkey book" obeys Heaps' power law precisely because its word-frequency distribution is not a smooth power law, contrary to the expectation based on simple mathematical arguments that if one is a power law, so is the other.},

  Abstract                 = {We are designing new data mining techniques on boolean contexts to identify a priori interesting bi-sets, i.e., sets of objects (or transactions) and associated sets of attributes (or items). It improves the state of the art in many application domains where transactional/boolean data are to be mined (e.g., basket analysis, WWW usage mining, gene expression data analysis). The so-called (formal) concepts are important special cases of a priori interesting bi-sets that associate closed sets on both dimensions thanks to the Galois operators. Concept mining in boolean data is tractable provided that at least one of the dimensions (number of objects or attributes) is small enough and the data is not too dense. The task is extremely hard otherwise. Furthermore, it is important to enable user-defined constraints on the desired bi-sets and use them during the extraction to increase both the efficiency and the a priori interestingness of the extracted patterns. It leads us to the design of a new algorithm, called D-Miner, for mining concepts under constraints. We provide an experimental validation on benchmark data sets. Moreover, we introduce an original data mining technique for microarray data analysis. Not only boolean expression properties of genes are recorded but also we add biological information about transcription factors. In such a context, D-Miner can be used for concept mining under constraints and outperforms the other studied algorithms. We show also that data enrichment is useful for evaluating the biological relevancy of the extracted concepts.},

The greatest difficulties to any scientific approach to cities have resulted from their many interdependent facets, as social, economic, infrastructural, and spatial complex systems that exist in similar but changing forms over a huge range of scales. Here, I show how all cities may evolve according to a small set of basic principles that operate locally. A theoretical framework was developed to predict the average social, spatial, and infrastructural properties of cities as a set of scaling relations that apply to all urban systems. Confirmation of these predictions was observed for thousands of cities worldwide, from many urban systems at different levels of development. Measures of urban efficiency, capturing the balance between socioeconomic outputs and infrastructural costs, were shown to be independent of city size and might be a useful means to evaluate urban planning strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {Grammatical agreement means that features associated with one linguistic unit (for example number or gender) become associated with another unit and then possibly overtly expressed, typically with morphological markers. It is one of the key mechanisms used in many languages to show that certain linguistic units within an utterance grammatically depend on each other. Agreement systems are puzzling because they can be highly complex in terms of what features they use and how they are expressed. Moreover, agreement systems have undergone considerable change in the historical evolution of languages. This article presents language game models with populations of agents in order to find out for what reasons and by what cultural processes and cognitive strategies agreement systems arise. It demonstrates that agreement systems are motivated by the need to minimize combinatorial search and semantic ambiguity, and it shows, for the first time, that once a population of agents adopts a strategy to invent, acquire and coordinate meaningful markers through social learning, linguistic self-organization leads to the spontaneous emergence and cultural transmission of an agreement system. The article also demonstrates how attested grammaticalization phenomena, such as phonetic reduction and conventionalized use of agreement markers, happens as a side effect of additional economizing principles, in particular minimization of articulatory effort and reduction of the marker inventory. More generally, the article illustrates a novel approach for studying how key features of human languages might emerge.},

  Abstract                 = {Over a hundred families of non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons (non-LTRs) were found in the newly released Anopheles gambiae genome assembly during a reiterative and comprehensive search using the conserved reverse transcriptase (RT) domains of known non-LTRs as the starting queries. These families, which are defined by at least 20\% amino acid sequence divergence in their RT domains, range from a few to approximately 2,000 copies and occupy at least 3\% of the genome. In addition to having an unprecedented number of diverse families, A. gambiae non-LTRs represent 8 of the 15 previously defined clades plus two novel clades, Loner and Outcast, more than what has been reported for any genome. Five families were found belonging to the L1 clade, which had no invertebrate representatives to date. One unique family named Sponge contains only a complete open reading frame (ORF) for the Gag-like protein and appears to have been mobilized by a family of the CR1 clade. Although most families appear to be inactive as expected, all clades except R4 have families with characteristics suggesting recent activity. At least 21 families have multiple full-length copies with over 99\% nucleotide identity and some or all of the following characteristics: target site duplications (TSDs), intact ORFs, and corresponding expressed sequence tags (ESTs). The incredible diversity and the maintenance of multiple recently active lineages within different clades indicate a complex evolutionary scenario. A. gambiae non-LTRs have the potential to be developed as tools for population genetic studies and genetic manipulations of this primary vector of the devastating disease malaria. The semi-automated reiterative search approach described here may be used with any genome assembly to systematically survey and characterize non-LTRs as well as other transposable elements that encode a conserved protein.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses applications of suffix trees and generalized suffix trees (GSTs) to biological sequence data analysis. We define a basic set of suffix trees and GST operations needed to support sequence data analysis. While those definitions are straightforward, the construction and manipulation of disk-based GST structures for large volumes of sequence data requires intricate design. GST processing is fast because the structure is content addressable, supporting efficient searches for all sequences that contain particular subsequences. Instead of laboriously searching sequences stored as arrays, we search by walking down the tree. We present a new GST-based sequence alignment algorithm, called GESTALT. GESTALT finds all exact matches in parallel, and uses best-first search to extend them to produce alignments. Our implementation experiences with applications using GST structures for sequence analysis lead us to conclude that GSTs are valuable tools for analyzing biological sequence data},

  Abstract                 = {New computer and statistical methods were used to determined significant direct and inverted repeats in the Escherichia coli contig sequence collection of aggregate 1[middle dot]6 x 106 base-pairs. Eight groups of mostly new structural repeat identities were uncovered. Apart from the high statistical significance of these repeat sequence, there are suggestive relationships of the group matches in terms of neighboring genes, of genomic distributions, of their texts, and of their potentials for secondary structure. Four of these groups are relatively numerous, 11 to 26 members, one is in coding sequences and three are in non-coding. The coding group consists of the ATP-activated transmembrane component of a typical high-affinity protein-binding transport system. One of the non-coding groups consists of a special rho-independent transcription termination signal closely following an processing RNA or DNA. A second non-coding group has, for one or both neighboring genes, a component of a system responding to stress or starvation for some nutrient.},

Doubts have been expressed regarding the plausibility of cross-situational learning as a mechanism for learning human-scale lexicons in reasonable timescales under the levels of referential uncertainty likely to confront real word learners. We demonstrate mathematically that cross-situational learning facilitates the acquisition of large vocabularies despite significant levels of referential uncertainty at each exposure, and we provide estimates of lexicon learning times for several cross-situational learning strategies. This model suggests that cross-situational word learning cannot be ruled out on the basis that it predicts unreasonably long lexicon learning times. More generally, these results indicate that there is no necessary link between the ability to learn individual words rapidly and the capacity to acquire a large lexicon.},

Beyond a small sample of lexical items whose properties are well studied, little is known about the dynamics of lexical evolution. How do the lexical inventories of languages, viewed as entire systems, evolve? Is the rate of evolution of the lexicon contingent upon historical factors or is it driven by regularities, perhaps to do with universals of cognition and social interaction? We address these questions using the Google Books N-Gram Corpus as a source of data and relative entropy as a measure of changes in the frequency distributions of words. It turns out that there are both universals and historical contingencies at work. Across several languages, we observe similar rates of change, but only at timescales of at least around five decades. At shorter timescales, the rate of change is highly variable and differs between languages. Major societal transformations as well as catastrophic events such as wars lead to increased change in frequency distributions, whereas stability in society has a dampening effect on lexical evolution.},

Quasi-periodic variations with characteristic time periods of 60-100 years were also found.},

  Abstract                 = {For many years, research on a suite of plant defense responses that begin when plants are exposed to general microbial elicitors was underappreciated, for a good reason: There has been no critical experimental demonstration of their importance in mediating plant resistance during pathogen infection. Today, these microbial elicitors are named pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or MAMPs) and the plant responses are known as PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). Recent studies provide an elegant explanation for the difficulty of demonstrating the role of PTI in plant disease resistance. It turns out that the important contribution of PTI to disease resistance is masked by pathogen virulence effectors that have evolved to suppress it.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: It has been well established that breastfeeding is beneficial for child health, however there has been debate regarding the effect of lactation on maternal health in the presence of HIV infection and the need for nutritional supplementation in HIV positive lactating mothers. AIMS: To assess the effect of nutritional supplementation to HIV infected lactating mothers on nutritional and health status of mothers and their infants. METHODS: A randomized controlled clinical trial to study the impact of nutritional supplementation on breastfeeding mothers. Measurements included anthropometry; body composition indicators; CD4 count, haemoglobin and albumin; as well as incidence rates of opportunistic infections; depression and quality of life scores. Infant measurements included anthropometry, development and rates of infections. RESULTS: The supplement made no significant impact on any maternal or infant outcomes. However in the small group of mothers with low BMI, the intake of supplement was significantly associated with preventing loss of lean body mass (1.32kg vs. 3.17 kg; p=0.026). There was no significant impact of supplementation on the infants. CONCLUSIONS: A 50 g daily nutritional supplement to breastfeeding mothers had no or limited effect on maternal and child health outcomes. Clinical Trial registration: ISRCTN68128332 (http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN68128332).},

  Abstract                 = {During the last ten years several studies have appeared regarding language complexity. Research on this issue began soon after the burst of a new movement of interest and research in the study of complex networks, i.e., networks whose structure is irregular, complex and dynamically evolving in time. In the first years, network approach to language mostly focused on a very abstract and general overview of language complexity, and few of them studied how this complexity is actually embodied in humans or how it affects cognition. However research has slowly shifted from the language-oriented towards a more cognitive-oriented point of view. This review first offers a brief summary on the methodological and formal foundations of complex networks, then it attempts a general vision of research activity on language from a complex networks perspective, and specially highlights those efforts with cognitive-inspired aim.},

  Abstract                 = {Alzheimer's Disease irremediably alters the proficiency of word search and retrieval processes even at its early stages. Such disruption can sometimes be paradoxical in specific language tasks, for example semantic priming. Here we focus in the striking side-effect of hyperpriming in Alzheimer's Disease patients, which has been well-established in the literature for a long time. Previous studies have evidenced that modern network theory can become a powerful complementary tool to gain insight in cognitive phenomena. Here, we first show that network modeling is an appropriate approach to account for semantic priming in normal subjects. Then we turn to priming in degraded cognition: hyperpriming can be readily understood in the scope of a progressive degradation of the semantic network structure. We compare our simulation results with previous empirical observations in diseased patients finding a qualitative agreement. The network approach presented here can be used to accommodate current theories about impaired cognition, and towards a better understanding of lexical organization in healthy and diseased patients.},

Genetic maps of two species of Louisiana Irises, Iris fulva and I. brevicaulis, were constructed from transposon-based molecular markers segregating in reciprocal backcross (BC1) interspecific hybrids and used to investigate genomic patterns of species barriers inhibiting introgression. Linkage mapping analyses indicated very little genetic incompatibility between I. fulva and I. brevicaulis in the form of map regions exhibiting transmission ratio distortion, and this was confirmed using a Bayesian multipoint mapping analysis. These results demonstrate the utility of transposon-based marker systems for genetic mapping studies of wild plant species and indicate that the genomes of I. fulva and I. brevicaulis are highly permeable to gene flow and introgression from one another via backcrossing.},

In such databases, similarity queries in the form of range queries or k-nearest-neighbor queries are the most important query types. In traditional query processing, single queries are issued independently by different users. In many data mining applications, however, the database is typically explored by iteratively asking similarity queries for answers of previous similarity queries. We introduce a generic scheme for such data mining algorithms and we investigate two orthogonal approaches, reducing I/O cost as well as CPU cost, to speed-up the processing of multiple similarity queries. The proposed techniques apply to any type of similarity query and to an implementation based on an index or using a sequential scan. Parallelization yields an additional impressive speed-up.

  Abstract                 = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Freund and Schapire[1996]), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

This paper presents a simple quantum model of a word association system. It is shown that a quantum model of word entanglement can recover aspects of both the Spreading Activation equation and the Spooky-activation-at-a-distance equation, both of which are used to model the activation level of words in human memory.},

However, there is less agreement about the precise computations involved, and the appropriate tests to distinguish between the various possibilities. It is important that the effect of the relevant design choices and parameter values are understood if psychological models using these methods are to be reliably evaluated and compared. In this article, we present a systematic exploration of the principal computational possibilities for formulating and validating representations of word meanings from word co-occurrence statistics. We find that, once we have identified the best procedures, a very simple approach is surprisingly successful and robust over a range of psychologically relevant evaluation measures.},

We provide an initial, theoretical solution to the challenge of de novo assembly from whole-genome shotgun "microreads." For 11 genomes of sizes up to 39 Mb, we generated high-quality assemblies from 80x coverage by paired 30-base simulated reads modeled after real Illumina-Solexa reads. The bacterial genomes of Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli assemble optimally, yielding single perfect contigs, and larger genomes yield assemblies that are highly connected and accurate. Assemblies are presented in a graph form that retains intrinsic ambiguities such as those arising from polymorphism, thereby providing information that has been absent from previous genome assemblies. For both C. jejuni and E. coli, this assembly graph is a single edge encompassing the entire genome. Larger genomes produce more complicated graphs, but the vast majority of the bases in their assemblies are present in long edges that are nearly always perfect. We describe a general method for genome assembly that can be applied to all types of DNA sequence data, not only short read data, but also conventional sequence reads.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: The discovery of sparse amino acid patterns that match repeatedly in a set of protein sequences is an important problem in computational biology. Statistically significant patterns, that is patterns that occur more frequently than expected, may identify regions that have been preserved by evolution and which may therefore play a key functional or structural role. Sparseness can be important because a handful of non-contiguous residues may play a key role, while others, in between, may be changed without significant loss of function or structure. Similar arguments may be applied to conserved DNA patterns. Available sparse pattern discovery algorithms are either inefficient or impose limitations on the type of patterns that can be discovered. Results: This paper introduces a deterministic pattern discovery algorithm, called Splash, which can find sparse amino or nucleic acid patterns matching identically or similarly in a set of protein or DNA sequences. Sparse patterns of any length, up to the size of the input sequence, can be discovered without significant loss in performances. Splash is extremely efficient and embarrassingly parallel by nature. Large databases, such as a complete genome or the non-redundant SWISS-PROT database can be processed in a few hours on a typical workstation. Alternatively, a protein family or superfamily, with low overall homology, can be analyzed to discover common functional or structural signatures. Some examples of biologically interesting motifs discovered by Splash are reported for the histone I and for the G-Protein Coupled Receptor families. Due to its efficiency, Splash can be used to systematically and exhaustively identify conserved regions in protein family sets. These can then be used to build accurate and sensitive PSSM or HMM models for sequence analysis. Availability: Splash is available to non-commercial research centers upon request, conditional on the signing of a test field agreement.

It is based on two aspects: (1) the analysis and simulation of boolean, kinetic and stochastic models and (2) the formalization of biological properties in temporal logic. BIOCHAM provides tools and languages for describing protein networks with a simple and straightforward syntax, and for integrating biological properties into the model. It then becomes possible to analyze, query, verify and maintain the model with respect to those properties. For kinetic models, BIOCHAM can search for appropriate parameter values in order to reproduce a specific behavior observed in experiments and formalized in temporal logic. Coupled with other methods such as bifurcation diagrams, this search assists the modeler/biologist in the modeling process.

Their de novo identification is still difficult despite being a crucial step in genomic analysis and oligonucleotides design. Several efficient algorithms based on word counting are available, but too short words decrease specificity while long words decrease sensitivity, particularly in degenerated repeats. Results: The Repeat Analysis Program (RAP) is based on a new word-counting algorithm optimized for high resolution repeat identification using gapped words. Many different overlapping gapped words can be counted at the same genomic position, thus producing a better signal than the single ungapped word. This results in better specificity both in terms of low-frequency detection, being able to identify sequences repeated only once, and highly divergent detection, producing a generally high score in most intron sequences.

  Abstract                 = {The size and complexity of actual networked systems hinders the access to a global knowledge of their structure. This fact pushes the problem of navigation to suboptimal solutions, one of them being the extraction of a coherent map of the topology on which navigation takes place. In this paper, we present a Markov chain based algorithm to tag networked terms according only to their topological features. The resulting tagging is used to compute similarity between terms, providing a map of the networked information. This map supports local-based navigation techniques driven by similarity. We compare the efficiency of the resulting paths according to their length compared to that of the shortest path. Additionally we claim that the path steps towards the destination are semantically coherent. To illustrate the algorithm performance we provide some results from the Simple English Wikipedia, which amounts to several thousand of pages. The simplest greedy strategy yields over an 80\% of average success rate. Furthermore, the resulting content-coherent paths most often have a cost between one- and threefold compared to shortest-path lengths.},

A great number of prediction programs have been developed that try to address one part of this problem, which consists of locating the genes along a genome. This paper reviews the existing approaches to predicting genes in eukaryotic genomes and underlines their intrinsic advantages and limitations. The main mathematical models and computational algorithms adopted are also briefly described and the resulting software classified according to both the method and the type of evidence used. Finally, the several difficulties and pitfalls encountered by the programs are detailed, showing that improvements are needed and that new directions must be considered.},

  Abstract                 = {A distributed classification paradigm known as collaborative tagging has been widely adopted in new Web applications designed to manage and share online resources. Users of these applications organize resources (Web pages, digital photographs, academic papers) by associating with them freely chosen text labels, or tags. Here we leverage the social aspects of collaborative tagging and introduce a notion of resource distance based on the collective tagging activity of users. We collect data from a popular system and perform experiments showing that our definition of distance can be used to build a weighted network of resources with a detectable community structure. We show that this community structure clearly exposes the semantic relations among resources. The communities of resources that we observe are a genuinely emergent feature, resulting from the uncoordinated activity of a large number of users, and their detection paves the way for mapping emergent semantics in social tagging systems.},

We study the temporal evolution of the global vocabulary size, i.e. the number of distinct tags in the entire system, as well as the evolution of local vocabularies, that is the growth of the number of distinct tags used in the context of a given resource or user. In both cases, we find power-law behaviors with exponents smaller than one. Surprisingly, the observed growth behaviors are remarkably regular throughout the entire history of the system and across very different resources being bookmarked. Similar sub-linear laws of growth have been observed in written text, and this qualitative universality calls for an explanation and points in the direction of non-trivial cognitive processes in the complex interaction patterns characterizing collaborative tagging.},

  Abstract                 = {The enormous increase of popularity and use of the worldwide web has led in the recent years to important changes in the ways people communicate. An interesting example of this fact is provided by the now very popular social annotation systems, through which users annotate resources (such as web pages or digital photographs) with keywords known as "tags." Understanding the rich emergent structures resulting from the uncoordinated actions of users calls for an interdisciplinary effort. In particular concepts borrowed from statistical physics, such as random walks (RWs), and complex networks theory, can effectively contribute to the mathematical modeling of social annotation systems. Here, we show that the process of social annotation can be seen as a collective but uncoordinated exploration of an underlying semantic space, pictured as a graph, through a series of RWs. This modeling framework reproduces several aspects, thus far unexplained, of social annotation, among which are the peculiar growth of the size of the vocabulary used by the community and its complex network structure that represents an externalization of semantic structures grounded in cognition and that are typically hard to access.},

Here we collect data from a popular system and investigate the statistical properties of tag cooccurrence. We introduce a stochastic model of user behavior embodying two main aspects of collaborative tagging: (i) a frequency-bias mechanism related to the idea that users are exposed to each other's tagging activity; (ii) a notion of memory, or aging of resources, in the form of a heavy-tailed access to the past state of the system. Remarkably, our simple modeling is able to account quantitatively for the observed experimental features with a surprisingly high accuracy. This points in the direction of a universal behavior of users who, despite the complexity of their own cognitive processes and the uncoordinated and selfish nature of their tagging activity, appear to follow simple activity patterns.},

New sequencing technologies are emerging that produce shorter reads (length 80-200 bp) but allow one to generate significantly higher coverage (30x and higher) at low cost. Modern assembly programs and error correction routines have been tuned to work well with current read technology but were not designed for assembly of short reads. Results: We analyze the limitations of assembling reads generated by these new technologies and present a routine for base-calling in reads prior to their assembly. We demonstrate that while it is feasible to assemble such short reads, the resulting contigs will require significant (if not prohibitive) finishing efforts.

In this study, we quantified male DNA in the human female brain as a marker for microchimerism of fetal origin (i.e. acquisition of male DNA by a woman while bearing a male fetus). Targeting the Y-chromosome-specific DYS14 gene, we performed real-time quantitative PCR in autopsied brain from women without clinical or pathologic evidence of neurologic disease (n=26), or women who had Alzheimer's disease (n=33). We report that 63\% of the females (37 of 59) tested harbored male microchimerism in the brain. Male microchimerism was present in multiple brain regions. Results also suggested lower prevalence (p=0.03) and concentration (p=0.06) of male microchimerism in the brains of women with Alzheimer's disease than the brains of women without neurologic disease. In conclusion, male microchimerism is frequent and widely distributed in the human female brain.},

  Abstract                 = {Long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons comprise a significant portion of the rice genome. Their complete characterization is thus necessary if the sequenced genome is to be annotated correctly. In addition, because LTR-retrotransposons can influence the expression of neighboring genes, the complete identification of these elements in the rice genome is essential in order to study their putative functional interactions with the plant genes. The aims of the database are to (i) Assemble a comprehensive dataset of LTR-retrotransposons that includes not only abundant elements, but also low copy number elements. (ii) Provide an interface to efficiently access the resources stored in the database. This interface should also allow the community to annotate these elements. (iii) Provide a means for identifying LTR-retrotransposons inserted near genes. Here we present the results, where 242 complete LTR-retrotransposons have been structurally and functionally annotated. A web interface to the database has been made available (http://www.retroryza.org/), through which the user can annotate a sequence or search for LTR-retrotransposons in the neighborhood of a gene of interest.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the viability and resilience of languages, using a simple dynamical model of two languages in competition. Assuming that public action can modify the prestige of a language in order to avoid language extinction, we analyze two cases: (i) the prestige can only take two values, (ii) it can take any value but its change at each time step is bounded. In both cases, we determine the viability kernel, that is, the set of states for which there exists an action policy maintaining the coexistence of the two languages, and we define such policies. We also study the resilience of the languages and identify configurations from where the system can return to the viability kernel (finite resilience), or where one of the languages is lead to disappear (zero resilience). Within our current framework, the maintenance of a bilingual society is shown to be possible by introducing the prestige of a language as a control variable.},

  Abstract                 = {The increasing popularity of Web 2.0 has led to exponential growth of user-generated content in both volume and significance. One important type of user-generated content is the blog. Blogs encompass useful information (e.g., insightful product reviews and information-rich consumer communities) that could potentially be a gold mine for business intelligence, bringing great opportunities for both academic research and business applications. However, performing business intelligence on blogs is quite challenging because of the vast amount of information and the lack of commonly adopted methodology for effectively collecting and analyzing such information. In this paper, we propose a framework for gathering business intelligence from blogs by automatically collecting and analyzing blog contents and bloggers' interaction networks. Through a system developed using the framework, we conducted two case studies with one case focusing on a consumer product and the other on a company. Our case studies demonstrate how to use the framework and appropriate techniques to effectively collect, extract, and analyze blogs related to the topics of interest, reveal novel patterns in the blogger interactions and communities, and answer important business intelligence questions in the domains. The framework is sufficiently generic and can be applied to any topics of interest, organizations, and products. Future academic research and business applications related to the topics examined in the two cases can also be built using the findings of this study.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Analysis of protein sequence and structure databases usually reveal frequent patterns (FP) associated with biological function. Data mining techniques generally consider the physicochemical and structural properties of amino acids and their microenvironment in the folded structures. Dynamics is not usually considered, although proteins are not static, and their function relates to conformational mobility in many cases. Results: This work describes a novel unsupervised learning approach to discover FPs in the protein families, based on biochemical, geometric and dynamic features. Without any prior knowledge of functional motifs, the method discovers the FPs for each type of amino acid and identifies the conserved residues in three protease subfamilies; chymotrypsin and subtilisin subfamilies of serine proteases and papain subfamily of cysteine proteases. The catalytic triad residues are distinguished by their strong spatial coupling (high interconnectivity) to other conserved residues. Although the spatial arrangements of the catalytic residues in the two subfamilies of serine proteases are similar, their FPs are found to be quite different. The present approach appears to be a promising tool for detecting functional patterns in rapidly growing structure databases and providing insights in to the relationship among protein structure, dynamics and function.

Traditionally, the most famous research method in attitude learning outcome is interview with open questionnaire. The drawback of interview method is the number of subjects is quite limited. This drawback can be improved by using new technology of text mining. Objective of this research is to find if there is any difference in cognitive learning for students from different backgrounds using text mining technology. The research is performed in three phases. First, documents of fifty four students concerning their thoughts after watching the film "Moon Child" were collected. High frequency terms were sifted from all terms to form the main thoughts of each and all documents. In the second phase, chaos theory was applied to divide these thoughts into two levels, basic concept level and attribute level. The main thoughts and each level of the main thoughts were visualized in network form and regarded as cognitive concept map. Finally, Average Path Length of cognitive concept maps were computed and analyzed. Experiment results indicate for students from different background, there is significant difference in their cognitive learning outcome. This result should be valuable for instructional design theory and can be served as an alternative in evaluating instructional outcome in the near future.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: E-communities, social groups interacting online, have recently become an object of interdisciplinary research. As with face-to-face meetings, Internet exchanges may not only include factual information but also emotional information--how participants feel about the subject discussed or other group members. Emotions in turn are known to be important in affecting interaction partners in offline communication in many ways. Could emotions in Internet exchanges affect others and systematically influence quantitative and qualitative aspects of the trajectory of e-communities? The development of automatic sentiment analysis has made large scale emotion detection and analysis possible using text messages collected from the web. However, it is not clear if emotions in e-communities primarily derive from individual group members' personalities or if they result from intra-group interactions, and whether they influence group activities. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, for the first time, we show the collective character of affective phenomena on a large scale as observed in four million posts downloaded from Blogs, Digg and BBC forums. To test whether the emotions of a community member may influence the emotions of others, posts were grouped into clusters of messages with similar emotional valences. The frequency of long clusters was much higher than it would be if emotions occurred at random. Distributions for cluster lengths can be explained by preferential processes because conditional probabilities for consecutive messages grow as a power law with cluster length. For BBC forum threads, average discussion lengths were higher for larger values of absolute average emotional valence in the first ten comments and the average amount of emotion in messages fell during discussions. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, our results prove that collective emotional states can be created and modulated via Internet communication and that emotional expressiveness is the fuel that sustains some e-communities.},

There is only a single parameter for this model that is meant to introduce a small amount of randomness in the otherwise preferential attachment based growth process. The experiments with this model parameter indicates that the choice of consonants among the languages within a family are far more preferential than it is across the families. The implications of this result are twofold -- (a) there is an innate preference of the speakers towards acquiring certain linguistic structures over others and (b) shared ancestry propels the stronger preferential connection between the languages within a family than across them. Furthermore, our observations indicate that this parameter might bear a correlation with the period of existence of the language families under investigation.},

  Abstract                 = {In the absence of a complete genome sequence, considerable insight into genome structure can be gained from survey sequencing of genomic DNA. To facilitate high-throughput characterization of genome structure based on shotgun sequence reads, we have developed an automated sequence read classification pipeline (SRCP). The SRCP uses a battery of novel and standard sequence analysis algorithms along with a sophisticated decision tree to place reads into "best fit" functional/descriptive categories. Once "primed" with genomic sequence data, the SRCP also permits estimation of gene/repeat enrichment afforded by reduced-representation sequencing techniques. To our knowledge, the SRCP is the only tool that has been designed to provide a description of a genome or a genome component based on sample sequence reads. In an initial test of the SRCP using sequence data from Sorghum bicolor, it was shown to provide results similar in quality to results generated by manual classification. Although the SRCP is not a replacement for manual sequence characterization, it can provide a rapid, high-quality overview of genome sequence content and facilitate subsequent annotation. The SRCP presumably can be adapted for analysis of any eukaryotic genome.},

A factor analysis on the use of these adjectives in the self-descriptions produced a 7-factor solution consisting of psychologically meaningful dimensions. Some dimensions were unipolar (e.g., Negativity factor, wherein most loaded items were negatively valenced adjectives); others were dimensional in that semantically opposite words clustered together (e.g., Sociability factor, wherein terms such as shy, outgoing, reserved, and loud all loaded in the same direction). The factors exhibited modest reliability across different types of writ writing samples and were correlated with self-reports and behaviors consistent with the dimensions. Similar analyses with additional content words (adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs) yielded additional psychological dimensions associated with physical appearance, school, relationships, etc. in which people contextualize their self-concepts. The results suggest that the meaning extraction method is a promising strategy that determines the dimensions along which people think about themselves.},

  Abstract                 = {SignificanceIn the modern electronic format it is both easier to reuse text and easier to detect reused text. This is the first comprehensive study of patterns of text reuse within the full texts of an important large scientific corpus, covering a 20-y timeframe. It provides an important baseline for what is regarded as standard practice within the affected research communities, a standard somewhat more lenient than that currently applied to journalists, popular authors, and public figures. We consider the incidence of text "reuse" by researchers via a systematic pairwise comparison of the text content of all articles deposited to arXiv.org from 1991 to 2012. We measure the global frequencies of three classes of text reuse and measure how chronic text reuse is distributed among authors in the dataset. We infer a baseline for accepted practice, perhaps surprisingly permissive compared with other societal contexts, and a clearly delineated set of aberrant authors. We find a negative correlation between the amount of reused text in an article and its influence, as measured by subsequent citations. Finally, we consider the distribution of countries of origin of articles containing large amounts of reused text.},

However, it is known that automatic multiple sequence alignments can often be improved by manual editing. Therefore, tools are needed to view and edit multiple sequence alignments. Due to growth in the sequence databases, multiple sequence alignments can often be large and difficult to view efficiently. The Jalview Java alignment editor is presented here, which enables fast viewing and editing of large multiple sequence alignments.

  Abstract                 = {The interest in modeling and analyzing human language with complex networks is on the rise in recent years and a considerable body of research in this area has already been accumulated. We survey three major lines of linguistic research from the complex network approach: 1) characterization of human language as a multi-level system with complex network analysis; 2) linguistic typological research with the application of linguistic networks and their quantitative measures; and 3) relationships between the system-level complexity of human language (determined by the topology of linguistic networks) and microscopic linguistic (e.g., syntactic) features (as the traditional concern of linguistics). We show that the models and quantitative tools of complex networks, when exploited properly, can constitute an operational methodology for linguistic inquiry, which contributes to the understanding of human language and the development of linguistics. We conclude our review with suggestions for future linguistic research from the complex network approach: 1) relationships between the system-level complexity of human language and microscopic linguistic features; 2) expansion of research scope from the global properties to other levels of granularity of linguistic networks; and 3) combination of linguistic network analysis with other quantitative studies of language (such as quantitative linguistics).},

  Abstract                 = {History-dependent processes are ubiquitous in natural and social systems. Many such processes, especially those that are associated with complex systems, become more constrained as they unfold: The set of possible outcomes of such processes reduces as they 'age'. We demonstrate that stochastic processes of this kind necessarily lead to Zipf's law in the overall rank distributions of their outcomes. Furthermore, if iid noise is added to such sample-space-reducing processes, the corresponding rank distributions are exact power laws, \$p(x)\backslash sim x\^{}\{-\backslash lambda\}\$, where the exponent \$0\backslash leq \backslash lambda \backslash leq 1\$ directly corresponds to the mixing ratio of process and noise. We illustrate sample-space-reducing processes with an intuitive example using a set of dice with different numbers of faces. Sample-space-reducing processes provide a new alternative to understand the origin of scaling in complex systems without the recourse to multiplicative, preferential, or self-organised-critical processes. Potential applications are numerous, ranging from language formation and network growth to statistics of human behaviour.},

  Abstract                 = {Zipf's law is the most common statistical distribution displaying scaling behavior. Cities, populations or firms are just examples of this seemingly universal law. Although many different models have been proposed, no general theoretical explanation has been shown to exist for its universality. Here we show that Zipf's law is, in fact, an inevitable outcome of a very general class of stochastic systems. Borrowing concepts from Algorithmic Information Theory, our derivation is based on the properties of the symbolic sequence obtained through successive observations over a system with an unbounded number of possible states. Specifically, we assume that the complexity of the description of the system provided by the sequence of observations is the one expected for a system evolving to a stable state between order and disorder. This result is obtained from a small set of mild, physically relevant assumptions. The general nature of our derivation and its model-free basis would explain the ubiquity of such a law in real systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Zipf's law is a fundamental paradigm in the statistics of written and spoken natural language as well as in other communication systems. We raise the question of the elementary units for which Zipf's law should hold in the most natural way, studying its validity for plain word forms and for the corresponding lemma forms. In order to have as homogeneous sources as possible, we analyze some of the longest literary texts ever written, comprising four different languages, with different levels of morphological complexity. In all cases Zipf's law is fulfilled, in the sense that a power-law distribution of word or lemma frequencies is valid for several orders of magnitude. We investigate the extent to which the word-lemma transformation preserves two parameters of Zipf's law: the exponent and the low-frequency cut-off. We are not able to demonstrate a strict invariance of the tail, as for a few texts both exponents deviate significantly, but we conclude that the exponents are very similar, despite the remarkable transformation that going from words to lemmas represents, considerably affecting all ranges of frequencies. In contrast, the low-frequency cut-offs are less stable.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantitative linguistics has provided us with a number of empirical laws that characterise the evolution of languages and competition amongst them. In terms of language usage, one of the most influential results is Zipf's law of word frequencies. Zipf's law appears to be universal, and may not even be unique to human language. However, there is ongoing controversy over whether Zipf's law is a good indicator of complexity. Here we present an alternative approach that puts Zipf's law in the context of critical phenomena (the cornerstone of complexity in physics) and establishes the presence of a large scale "attraction" between successive repetitions of words. Moreover, this phenomenon is scale-invariant and universal -- the pattern is independent of word frequency and is observed in texts by different authors and written in different languages. There is evidence, however, that the shape of the scaling relation changes for words that play a key role in the text, implying the existence of different "universality classes" in the repetition of words. These behaviours exhibit striking parallels with complex catastrophic phenomena.},

This extensive sequence resource, encompassing species with well-defined phylogenetic relationships, provides a model system for comparative genomic analyses. FlyBase has developed tools to facilitate access to and navigation through this invaluable new data collection.},

In this article we illustrate some basic features of error bars and explain how they can help communicate data and assist correct interpretation. Error bars may show confidence intervals, standard errors, standard deviations, or other quantities. Different types of error bars give quite different information, and so figure legends must make clear what error bars represent. We suggest eight simple rules to assist with effective use and interpretation of error bars.},

  Abstract                 = {This software article describes the GATE family of open source text analysis tools and processes. GATE is one of the most widely used systems of its type with yearly download rates of tens of thousands and many active users in both academic and industrial contexts. In this paper we report three examples of GATE-based systems operating in the life sciences and in medicine. First, in genome-wide association studies which have contributed to discovery of a head and neck cancer mutation association. Second, medical records analysis which has significantly increased the statistical power of treatment/outcome models in the UK's largest psychiatric patient cohort. Third, richer constructs in drug-related searching. We also explore the ways in which the GATE family supports the various stages of the lifecycle present in our examples. We conclude that the deployment of text mining for document abstraction or rich search and navigation is best thought of as a process, and that with the right computational tools and data collection strategies this process can be made defined and repeatable. The GATE research programme is now 20 years old and has grown from its roots as a specialist development tool for text processing to become a rather comprehensive ecosystem, bringing together software developers, language engineers and research staff from diverse fields. GATE now has a strong claim to cover a uniquely wide range of the lifecycle of text analysis systems. It forms a focal point for the integration and reuse of advances that have been made by many people (the majority outside of the authors' own group) who work in text processing for biomedicine and other areas. GATE is available online <1> under GNU open source licences and runs on all major operating systems. Support is available from an active user and developer community and also on a commercial basis.},

  Abstract                 = {Human languages are rule governed, but almost invariably these rules have exceptions in the form of irregularities. Since rules in language are efficient and productive, the persistence of irregularity is an anomaly. How does irregularity linger in the face of internal (endogenous) and external (exogenous) pressures to conform to a rule? Here we address this problem by taking a detailed look at simple past tense verbs in the Corpus of Historical American English. The data show that the language is open, with many new verbs entering. At the same time, existing verbs might tend to regularize or irregularize as a consequence of internal dynamics, but overall, the amount of irregularity sustained by the language stays roughly constant over time. Despite continuous vocabulary growth, and presumably, an attendant increase in expressive power, there is no corresponding growth in irregularity. We analyze the set of irregulars, showing they may adhere to a set of minority rules, allowing for increased stability of irregularity over time. These findings contribute to the debate on how language systems become rule governed, and how and why they sustain exceptions to rules, providing insight into the interplay between the emergence and maintenance of rules and exceptions in language.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: In the past decade, there has been an increasing national policy push for educators to systematically collect, interpret, and use data for instructional decision making. The assumption by the federal government is that having data systems will be enough to prompt the use of data for a wide range of decision making. These policies rely on inducements to inspire local level changes; however, they leave the processes related to data use largely undefined. Objective: In this article, I argue that many of the studies on data use either invoke or directly assess networkâ€�related concepts and, as such, network theory and analysis provides a useful analytic and complementary framework and methods for examining the social infrastructure in the use of data for educational improvement. Research Design: This article reports on a literature review of the data use and social network literatures and the utility of intersecting both literatures for studies on data use for educational improvement. Conclusions: Many data use studies report that the interpretation and use of data takes place both within and between individuals who, through social interaction, are both coâ€�constructing and making sense of data and their use. Given the increasing role of social relationships in data use studies better theorizing and understanding the dynamics of social influence and processes on the interpretation and use of data is needed. Social network theory and analysis offers a useful conceptual framework and accompanying methods for describing and analyzing the structure of a social system in an effort to understand how social relationships support and constrain the interpretation and use of data in educational improvement.

  Abstract                 = {Summary: Growth of genome data and analysis possibilities have brought new levels of difficulty for scientists to understand, integrate and deal with all this ever-increasing information. In this scenario, GARSA has been conceived aiming to facilitate the tasks of integrating, analyzing and presenting genomic information from several bioinformatics tools and genomic databases, in a flexible way. GARSA is a user-friendly web-based system designed to analyze genomic data in the context of a pipeline. EST and GGS data can be analyzed using the system since it accepts (1) chromatograms, (2) download of sequences from GenBank, (3) Fasta files stored locally or (4) a combination of all three. Quality evaluation of chromatograms, vector removing and clusterization are easily performed as part of the pipeline. A number of local and customizable Blast and CDD analyses can be performed as well as Interpro, complemented with phylogeny analyses. GARSA is being used for the analyses of Trypanosoma vivax (GSS and EST), Trypanosoma rangeli (GSS, EST and ORESTES), Bothrops jararaca (EST), Piaractus mesopotamicus (EST) and Lutzomyia longipalpis (EST).

  Abstract                 = {Recent work in unsupervised feature learning and deep learning has shown that being able to train large models can dramatically improve performance. In this paper, we consider the problem of training a deep network with billions of parameters using tens of thousands of CPU cores. We have developed a software framework called DistBelief that can utilize computing clusters with thousands of machines to train large models. Within this framework, we have developed two algorithms for large-scale distributed training: (i) Downpour SGD, an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent procedure supporting a large number of model replicas, and (ii) Sandblaster, a framework that supports a variety of distributed batch optimization procedures, including a distributed implementation of L-BFGS. Downpour SGD and Sandblaster L-BFGS both increase the scale and speed of deep network training. We have successfully used our system to train a deep network 30x larger than previously reported in the literature, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet, a visual object recognition task with 16 million images and 21k categories. We show that these same techniques dramatically accelerate the training of a more modestly- sized deep network for a commercial speech recognition service. Although we focus on and report performance of these methods as applied to training large neural networks, the underlying algorithms are applicable to any gradient-based machine learning algorithm},

Programmers find the system easy to use: more than ten thousand distinct MapReduce programs have been implemented internally at Google over the past four years, and an average of one hundred thousand MapReduce jobs are executed on Google's clusters every day, processing a total of more than twenty petabytes of data per day.},

The new system, MUMmer 2, runs three times faster while using one-third as much memory as the original MUMmer system. It has been used successfully to align the entire human and mouse genomes to each other, and to align numerous smaller eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes. A new module permits the alignment of multiple DNA sequence fragments, which has proven valuable in the comparison of incomplete genome sequences. We also describe a method to align more distantly related genomes by detecting protein sequence homology. This extension to MUMmer aligns two genomes after translating the sequence in all six reading frames, extracts all matching protein sequences and then clusters together matches. This method has been applied to both incomplete and complete genome sequences in order to detect regions of conserved synteny, in which multiple proteins from one organism are found in the same order and orientation in another. The system code is being made freely available by the authors.},

The scenario of its validity is similar to the Zipf's law for words in short English texts. For long Chinese texts (or for mixtures of short Chinese texts), rank-frequency relations for Chinese characters display a two-layer, hierarchic structure that combines a Zipfian power-law regime for frequent characters (first layer) with an exponential-like regime for less frequent characters (second layer). For these two layers we provide different (though related) theoretical descriptions that include the range of low-frequency characters (hapax legomena). The comparative analysis of rank-frequency relations for Chinese characters versus English words illustrates the extent to which the characters play for Chinese writers the same role as the words for those writing within alphabetical systems.},

We identified previously unannotated and often tissue- or cell-line-specific transcribed fragments (RACEfrags), both 5' distal to the annotated 5' terminus and internal to the annotated gene bounds for the vast majority (81.5\%) of the tested genes. Half of the distal RACEfrags span large segments of genomic sequences away from the main portion of the coding transcript and often overlap with the upstream-annotated gene(s). Notably, at least 20\% of the resultant novel transcripts have changes in their open reading frames (ORFs), most of them fusing ORFs of adjacent transcripts. A significant fraction of distal RACEfrags show expression levels comparable to those of known exons of the same locus, suggesting that they are not part of very minority splice forms. These results have significant implications concerning (1) our current understanding of the architecture of protein-coding genes; (2) our views on locations of regulatory regions in the genome; and (3) the interpretation of sequence polymorphisms mapping to regions hitherto considered to be "noncoding," ultimately relating to the identification of disease-related sequence alterations.},

Nat. Acad. Sci. 100 788). Direct analysis shows that the minimum cost is min\{$\lambda$,1 âˆ’ $\lambda$\}, where $\lambda$ determines the relative weights of speakerâ€™s and hearerâ€™s costs in the total, as shown in several previous works using different approaches. The nature and multiplicity of the minimizing solution change discontinuously at $\lambda$ = 1/2, being qualitatively different for $\lambda$ 1/2, and $\lambda$ = 1/2. Zipfâ€™s law is found only in a vanishing fraction of the minimum-cost solutions at $\lambda$ = 1/2 and therefore is not explained by this model. Imposing the further condition of equal costs yields distributions substantially closer to Zipfâ€™s law ones, but significant differences persist. We also investigate the solutions reached with the previously used minimization algorithm and find that they correctly recover global minimum states at the transition.},

Using published Cot data as a guide, 2 genomic libraries for hexaploid wheat were constructed from the single-stranded DNA collected at Cot values > 1188 and 1639 MÂ·s. Compared with sequences from a whole genome shotgun library from Aegilops tauschii (the D genome donor of bread wheat), the CF libraries exhibited 13.7-fold enrichment in genes, 5.8-fold enrichment in unknown low-copy sequences, and a 3-fold reduction in repetitive DNA. CF is twice as efficient as methylation filtration at enriching wheat genes. This research suggests that, with improvements, CF will be a highly useful tool in sequencing the gene space of wheat.},

Natural language processing (NLP) provides a means of unlocking this important data source for applications in clinical decision support, quality assurance, and public health. This chapter provides an overview of representative NLP systems in biomedicine based on a unified architectural view. A general architecture in an NLP system consists of two main components: background knowledge that includes biomedical knowledge resources and a framework that integrates NLP tools to process text. Systems differ in both components, which we review briefly. Additionally, the challenge facing current research efforts in biomedical NLP includes the paucity of large, publicly available annotated corpora, although initiatives that facilitate data sharing, system evaluation, and collaborative work between researchers in clinical NLP are starting to emerge.},

Alongside these general regularities, we describe inter-language variations in the emotional spectrum of languages which allow us to rank corpora. We also show how our word evaluations can be used to construct physical-like instruments for both real-time and offline measurement of the emotional content of large-scale texts.},

  Abstract                 = {Individual happiness is a fundamental societal metric. Normally measured through self-report, happiness has often been indirectly characterized and overshadowed by more readily quantifiable economic indicators such as gross domestic product. Here, we examine expressions made on the online, global microblog and social networking service Twitter, uncovering and explaining temporal variations in happiness and information levels over timescales ranging from hours to years. Our data set comprises over 46 billion words contained in nearly 4.6 billion expressions posted over a 33 month span by over 63 million unique users. In measuring happiness, we use a real-time, remote-sensing, non-invasive, text-based approach---a kind of hedonometer. In building our metric, made available with this paper, we conducted a survey to obtain happiness evaluations of over 10,000 individual words, representing a tenfold size improvement over similar existing word sets. Rather than being ad hoc, our word list is chosen solely by frequency of usage and we show how a highly robust metric can be constructed and defended.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Many commonly used genome browsers display sequence annotations and related attributes as horizontal data tracks that can be toggled on and off according to user preferences. Most genome browsers use only simple keyword searches and limit the display of detailed annotations to one chromosomal region of the genome at a time. We have employed concepts, methodologies, and tools that were developed for the display of geographic data to develop a Genome Spatial Information System (GenoSIS) for displaying genomes spatially, and interacting with genome annotations and related attribute data. In contrast to the paradigm of horizontally stacked data tracks used by most genome browsers, GenoSIS uses the concept of registered spatial layers composed of spatial objects for integrated display of diverse data. In addition to basic keyword searches, GenoSIS supports complex queries, including spatial queries, and dynamically generates genome maps. Our adaptation of the geographic information system (GIS) model in a genome context supports spatial representation of genome features at multiple scales with a versatile and expressive query capability beyond that supported by existing genome browsers.RESULTS:We implemented an interactive genome sequence feature map for the mouse genome in GenoSIS, an application that uses ArcGIS, a commercially available GIS software system. The genome features and their attributes are represented as spatial objects and data layers that can be toggled on and off according to user preferences or displayed selectively in response to user queries. GenoSIS supports the generation of custom genome maps in response to complex queries about genome features based on both their attributes and locations. Our example application of GenoSIS to the mouse genome demonstrates the powerful visualization and query capability of mature GIS technology applied in a novel domain.CONCLUSION:Mapping tools developed specifically for geographic data can be exploited to display, explore and interact with genome data. The approach we describe here is organism independent and is equally useful for linear and circular chromosomes. One of the unique capabilities of GenoSIS compared to existing genome browsers is the capacity to generate genome feature maps dynamically in response to complex attribute and spatial queries.},

Arrays of three or more transgenes produced phenotypes similar to classical heterochromatin-induced position-effect variegation (PEV), and these phenotypes were modified by known modifiers of PEV. This effect on the repeated transgenes was much stronger for a site near centric heterochromatin than it was for a medial site, and it strengthened with increasing copy number. Differences between variegated phenotypes could be accounted for if different topological structures were generated by pairing between closely linked repeat sequences. We propose that pairing of repeats underlies heterochromatin formation and is responsible for diverse gene silencing phenomena in animals and plants.},

In such a treatment, each distinct word in language is a vertex of this web, and interacting words in sentences are connected by edges. The empirical distribution of the number of connections of words in this network is of a peculiar form that includes two pronounced power-law regions. Here we propose a theory of the evolution of language, which treats language as a self-organizing network of interacting words. In the framework of this concept, we completely describe the observed word web structure without any fitting. We show that the two regimes in the distribution naturally emerge from the evolutionary dynamics of the word web. It follows from our theory that the size of the core part of language, the 'kernel lexicon', does not vary as language evolves.},

The first approach is based on the concept of curvature and divides the word graph into classes of similar words by removing words of low curvature which connect several dispersed clusters. The second method, instead of clustering the nodes, clusters the links in our graph. These contain more specific contextual information than nodes representing just words. In so doing, we naturally accommodate ambiguity by allowing multiple class membership. Both methods are evaluated on a lexical acquisition task, using clustering to add nouns to the WordNet taxonomy. The most effective method is link clustering.},

Until now, detection of various kinds of DNA repeats accurately is still an open problem. In this article, we propose a new method and a visualization tool for detecting DNA repeats in a 2D plane of location and frequency by using optimized moving window spectral analysis. The spectrogram can display the general distribution of repetitive sequences while showing the repeat period, length and location without any prior knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is accurate and robust even under the condition of excessive mutating and interleaving.

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Supporting the functionality of recent duplicate gene copies is usually difficult, owing to high sequence similarity between duplicate counterparts and shallow phylogenies, which hamper both the statistical and experimental inference. Results: We developed an integrated evolutionary approach to identify functional duplicate gene copies and other lineage-specific genes. By repeatedly simulating neutral evolution, our method estimates the probability that an ORF was selectively conserved and is therefore likely to represent a bona fide coding region. In parallel, our method tests whether the accumulation of non-synonymous substitutions reveals signatures of selective constraint. We show that our approach has high power to identify functional lineage-specific genes using simulated and real data. For example, a coding region of average length ([\~{}]1400 bp), restricted to hominoids, can be predicted to be functional in [\~{}]94-100\% of cases. Notably, the method may support functionality for instances where classical selection tests based on the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions fail to reveal signatures of selection. Our method is available as an automated tool, ReEVOLVER, which will also be useful to systematically detect functional lineage-specific genes of closely related species on a large scale.

The proposed model provides a computationally-appealing framework to support decision making, while accounting for functional interdependencies that link the facilities that comprise these systems. In particular, the formulation explicitly captures the bidirectional relationship between demand and deterioration. That is, the state of a facility, i.e., its condition or capacity, impacts the demand/traffic; while simultaneously, demand determines a facility's deterioration rate. The elements that comprise transportation systems are linked because the state of a facility can impact demand at other facilities. We provide a series of numerical examples to illustrate the advantages of the proposed framework. Specifically, we analyze simple network topologies and traffic patterns where it is optimal to coordinate (synchronize or alternate) interventions for clusters of facilities in transportation systems.

The longest correlations found in our analysis comprise a few hundreds or thousands of letters and may be understood as long--wave fluctuations of the composition.},

The analysis is based on the calculation of entropy like quantities as the mutual information for pairs of letters and the entropy, the mean uncertainty, per letter. We further estimate the number of different subwords of a given length \{$\backslash$\$\}n\{\backslash\$\}. Filtering out the contributions due to the effects of the finite length of the texts, we find correlations ranging to a few hundred letters. Scaling laws for the mutual information (decay with a power law), for the entropy per letter (decay with the inverse square root of \{$\backslash$\$\}n\{\backslash\$\}) and for the word numbers (stretched exponential growth with \{$\backslash$\$\}n\{\backslash\$\} and with a power law of the text length) were found.},

For information carrying strings generated by one source (i.e. a novel or a piece of music) we find correlations on many length scales. The word distribution, the higher order entropies and the transinformation are calculated. The analogy to strings generated through symbolic dynamics by nonlinear systems in critical states is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Sequencing of prokaryotic genomes has recently revealed the presence of CRISPR elements: short, highly conserved repeats separated by unique sequences of similar length. The distinctive sequence signature of CRISPR repeats can be found using general-purpose repeat- or pattern-finding software tools. However, the output of such tools is not always ideal for studying these repeats, and significant effort is sometimes needed to build additional tools and perform manual analysis of the output.RESULTS:We present PILER-CR, a program specifically designed for the identification and analysis of CRISPR repeats. The program executes rapidly, completing a 5 Mb genome in around 5 seconds on a current desktop computer. We validate the algorithm by manual curation and by comparison with published surveys of these repeats, finding that PILER-CR has both high sensitivity and high specificity. We also present a catalogue of putative CRISPR repeats identified in a comprehensive analysis of 346 prokaryotic genomes.CONCLUSION:PILER-CR is a useful tool for rapid identification and classification of CRISPR repeats. The software is donated to the public domain. Source code and a Linux binary are freely available at http://www.drive5.com/pilercr.},

De novo computational identification and classification of such elements is a challenging problem. Therefore, repeat annotation of sequenced genomes has historically largely relied on sequence similarity to hand-curated libraries of known repeat families. We present a new approach to de novo repeat annotation that exploits characteristic patterns of local alignments induced by certain classes of repeats. We describe PILER, a package of efficient search algorithms for identifying such patterns. Novel repeats found using PILER are reported for Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thalania and Drosophila melanogaster.

It recognizes the significantly different requirements of spatial data handling and overcomes the inherent problems of the application of conventional database query languages. The spatial query language has been designed as a minimal extension to the interrogative part of SQL and distinguishes from previously designed SQL extensions by: the preservation of SQL concepts; the high-level treatment of spatial objects; and the incorporation of spatial operations and relationships. It consists of two components, a query language to describe what information to retrieve and a presentation language to specify how to display query results. Users can ask standard SQL queries to retrieve nonspatial data based on nonspatial constraints, use Spatial SQL commands to inquire about situations involving spatial data, and give instructions in the Graphical Presentation Language, GPL to manipulate or examine the graphical presentation},

Comparative analysis reveals a compact avian genome structure containing a similar number of genes as found in mammals but with shorter intergenic DNA sequences and fewer repeats. Recombination is at a higher rate than in mammals, particularly for microchromosomes. These also differ from macrochromosomes in their GC and gene content, and their substitution rate. The avian genome has remained unusually stable during evolution and contrasts sharply with the frequent chromosomal rearrangements seen in the rodent lineage. Detailed analyses of polymorphism levels in chickens, including a genome-wide screening in three chicken breeds yielding a set of 2.8 million SNP markers, reveal unexpectedly high levels of genetic diversity. As a notable exception, the female-specific W chromosome is very low in diversity, a probable consequence of the effect of selection on non-recombining chromosomes. The chicken genome promises to be a useful resource for ecological and evolutionary studies of other bird species.},

  Abstract                 = {The advantages of predictive modeling in glioma grading from MR perfusion images have not yet been explored. The aim of the current study was to implement a predictive model based on support vector machines (SVM) for glioma grading using tumor blood volume histogram signatures derived from MR perfusion images and to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the model and the sensitivity to sample size. A total of 86 patients with histologically-confirmed gliomas were imaged using dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI at 1.5T. Histogram signatures from 53 of the 86 patients were analyzed independently by four neuroradiologists and used as a basis for the predictive SVM model. The resulting SVM model was tested on the remaining 33 patients and analyzed by a fifth neuroradiologist. At optimal SVM parameters, the true positive rate (TPR) and true negative rate (TNR) of the SVM model on the 33 patients was 0.76 and 0.82, respectively. The interobserver agreement and the TPR increased significantly when the SVM model was based on an increasing sample size (P < 0.001). This result suggests that a predictive SVM model can aid in the diagnosis of glioma grade from MR perfusion images and that the model improves with increasing sample size.},

  Abstract                 = {The hippocampus shrinks in late adulthood, leading to impaired memory and increased risk for dementia. Hippocampal and medial temporal lobe volumes are larger in higher-fit adults, and physical activity training increases hippocampal perfusion, but the extent to which aerobic exercise training can modify hippocampal volume in late adulthood remains unknown. Here we show, in a randomized controlled trial with 120 older adults, that aerobic exercise training increases the size of the anterior hippocampus, leading to improvements in spatial memory. Exercise training increased hippocampal volume by 2\%, effectively reversing age-related loss in volume by 1 to 2 y. We also demonstrate that increased hippocampal volume is associated with greater serum levels of BDNF, a mediator of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. Hippocampal volume declined in the control group, but higher preintervention fitness partially attenuated the decline, suggesting that fitness protects against volume loss. Caudate nucleus and thalamus volumes were unaffected by the intervention. These theoretically important findings indicate that aerobic exercise training is effective at reversing hippocampal volume loss in late adulthood, which is accompanied by improved memory function.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a stochastic graph-based method for computing relative importance of textual units for Natural Language Processing. We test the technique on the problem of Text Summarization (TS). Extractive TS relies on the concept of sentence salience to identify the most important sentences in a document or set of documents. Salience is typically defined in terms of the presence of particular important words or in terms of similarity to a centroid pseudo-sentence. We consider a new approach, LexRank, for computing sentence importance based on the concept of eigenvector centrality in a graph representation of sentences. In this model, a connectivity matrix based on intra-sentence cosine similarity is used as the adjacency matrix of the graph representation of sentences. Our system, based on LexRank ranked in first place in more than one task in the recent DUC 2004 evaluation. In this paper we present a detailed analysis of our approach and apply it to a larger data set including data from earlier DUC evaluations. We discuss several methods to compute centrality using the similarity graph. The results show that degree-based methods (including LexRank) outperform both centroid-based methods and other systems participating in DUC in most of the cases. Furthermore, the LexRank with threshold method outperforms the other degree-based techniques including continuous LexRank. We also show that our approach is quite insensitive to the noise in the data that may result from an imperfect topical clustering of documents.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Spatial data mining algorithms heavily depend on the efficient processing of neighborhood relations since the neighbors of many objects have to be investigated in a single run of a typical algorithm. Therefore, providing general concepts for neighborhood relations as well as an efficient implementation of these concepts will allow a tight integration of spatial data mining algorithms with a spatial database management system. This will speed up both, the development and the execution of spatial data mining algorithms. In this paper, we define neighborhood graphs and paths and a small set of database primitives for their manipulation. We show that typical spatial data mining algorithms are well supported by the proposed basic operations. For finding significant spatial patterns, only certain classes of paths â€œleading awayâ€� from a starting object are relevant. We discuss filters allowing only such neighborhood paths which will significantly reduce the search space for spatial data mining algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce neighborhood indices to speed up the processing of our database primitives. We implemented the database primitives on top of a commercial spatial database management system. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach was evaluated by using an analytical cost model and an extensive experimental study on a geographic database.},

Unlike the CD algorithm, the IDD algorithm partitions the candidate set intelligently among processors to efficiently parallelize the step of building the hash tree. The IDD algorithm also eliminates the redundant work inherent in DD, and requires substantially smaller communication overhead than DD. But IDD suffers from the added cost due to communication of transactions among processors. HD is a hybrid algorithm that combines the advantages of CD and DD. Experimental results on a 128-processor Cray T3E show that HD scales just as well as the CD algorithm with respect to the number of transactions, and scales as well as IDD with respect to increasing candidate set size},

In the comparison model, there is a trivial \&Omega;(n log n)-time lower bound based on sorting, and Weiner's algorithm matches this bound trivially. For integer alphabets, a substantial gap remains between the known upper and lower bounds, and closing this gap is the main open question in the construction of suffix trees. There is no super-linear lower bound, and the fastest known algorithm was the O(n log n) time comparison based algorithm.

  Abstract                 = {Prior investigations of functional specialization have focused on the response profiles of particular brain regions. Given the growing emphasis on regional covariation, we propose to reframe these questions in terms of brain 'networks' (collections of regions jointly engaged by some mental process). Despite the challenges that investigations of the language network face, a network approach may prove useful in understanding the cognitive architecture of language. We propose that a language network plausibly includes a functionally specialized 'core' (brain regions that coactivate with each other during language processing) and a domain-general 'periphery' (a set of brain regions that may coactivate with the language core regions at some times but with other specialized systems at other times, depending on task demands). Framing the debate around network properties such as this may prove to be a more fruitful way to advance our understanding of the neurobiology of language.},

  Abstract                 = {Fluent speakers' representations of verbs include semantic knowledge about the nouns that can serve as their arguments. These "selectional restrictions" of a verb can in principle be recruited to learn the meaning of a novel noun. For example, the sentence He ate the carambola licenses the inference that carambola refers to something edible. We ask whether 15- and 19-month-old infants can recruit their nascent verb lexicon to identify the referents of novel nouns that appear as the verbs' subjects. We compared infants' interpretation of a novel noun (e.g., the dax) in two conditions: one in which dax is presented as the subject of animate-selecting construction (e.g., The dax is crying), and the other in which dax is the subject of an animacy-neutral construction (e.g., The dax is right here). Results indicate that by 19months, infants use their representations of known verbs to inform the meaning of a novel noun that appears as its argument.},

The statisticalproperties of these networks have been recently studied and various features such as the small-world phenomenon and a scale-free distribution of degrees have been found. Our work focuses on four classes of words: verbs, nouns, adverbs and adjectives. Here, we use spectral methods sorting vertices. We show that the ordering clusters words of the same class. For nouns and verbs, the cluster size distribution clearly follows a power-law distribution that cannot be explained by a null hypothesis. Long-range correlations are found between vertices in theordering provided by the spectral method. The findings support the use of spectral methods for detecting community structure.},

  Abstract                 = {Many languages are spoken on Earth. Despite their diversity, many robust language universals are known to exist. All languages share syntax, i.e., the ability of combining words for forming sentences. The origin of such traits is an issue of open debate. By using recent developments from the statistical physics of complex networks, we show that different syntactic dependency networks (from Czech, German, and Romanian) share many nontrivial statistical patterns such as the small world phenomenon, scaling in the distribution of degrees, and disassortative mixing. Such previously unreported features of syntax organization are not a trivial consequence of the structure of sentences, but an emergent trait at the global scale.},

  Abstract                 = {Words in human language interact in sentences in non-random ways, and allow humans to construct an astronomic variety of sentences from a limited number of discrete units. This construction process is extremely fast and robust. The co-occurrence of words in sentences reflects language organization in a subtle manner that can be described in terms of a graph of word interactions. Here, we show that such graphs display two important features recently found in a disparate number of complex systems. (i) The so called small-world effect. In particular, the average distance between two words, d (i.e. the average minimum number of links to be crossed from an arbitrary word to another), is shown to be d approximately equal to 2-3, even though the human brain can store many thousands. (ii) A scale-free distribution of degrees. The known pronounced effects of disconnecting the most connected vertices in such networks can be identified in some language disorders. These observations indicate some unexpected features of language organization that might reflect the evolutionary and social history of lexicons and the origins of their flexibility and combinatorial nature.},

The framework relies on the well-known positive correlation between cognitive cost and the Euclidean distance between the elements (e. g. words) involved in a syntactic link. We study the conditions under which a certain word order is more economical than an alternative word order by proposing a mathematical approach. We apply our methodology to two different cases: (a) the ordering of subject (S), verb (V) and object (O), and (b) the covering of a root word by a syntactic link. For the former, we find that SVO and its symmetric, OVS, are more economical than OVS, SOV, VOS and VSO at least 2/3 of the time. For the latter, we find that uncovering the root word is more economical than covering it at least 1/2 of the time. With the help of our framework, one can explain some Greenbergian universals. Our findings provide further theoretical support for the hypothesis that the limited resources of the brain introduce biases toward certain word orders. Our theoretical findings could inspire or illuminate future psycholinguistics or corpus linguistics studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Menzerath's law, the tendency of Z, the mean size of the parts, to decrease as X, the number of parts, increases is found in language, music and genomes. Recently, it has been argued that the presence of the law in genomes is an inevitable consequence of the fact that Z = Y/X, which would imply that Z \~{} 1/X. Z \~{} 1/X is a very particular case of Menzerath-Altmann law that has been rejected by means of a correlation test between X and Y in genomes, being X the number of chromosomes of a species, Y its genome size in bases and Z the mean chromosome size. Here we provide rigorous statistical arguments to support the correctness of rejecting Z \~{} 1/X when X and Y are significantly correlated. Furthermore, we correct the recent claim that Z \~{} 1/X holds if and only if X and Y are independent (Baixeries et al. 2012, Biosystems 107 (3), 167-173). Indeed, Z \~{} 1/X if and only if Y is mean independent of X, a statistical property of intermediate strength between independence and uncorrelation. However, it is still true that the random breakage model proposed to explain Z \~{} 1/X with independence between X and Y does not fit real genome data. We reject Z \~{} 1/X in ten out of eleven taxonomic groups by means of a new correlation ratio test.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, it has been claimed that a linear relationship between a measure of information content and word length is expected from word length optimization and it has been shown that this linearity is supported by a strong correlation between information content and word length in many languages (Piantadosi et al. 2011, PNAS 108, 3825-3826). Here, we study in detail some connections between this measure and standard information theory. The relationship between the measure and word length is studied for the popular random typing process where a text is constructed by pressing keys at random from a keyboard containing letters and a space behaving as a word delimiter. Although this random process does not optimize word lengths according to information content, it exhibits a linear relationship between information content and word length. The exact slope and intercept are presented for three major variants of the random typing process. A strong correlation between information content and word length can simply arise from the units making a word (e.g., letters) and not necessarily from the interplay between a word and its context as proposed by Piantadosi et al. In itself, the linear relation does not entail the results of any optimization process.},

  Abstract                 = {Mariner-like elements (MLEs) are DNA transposons found throughout the plant and animal kingdoms. A previous computational survey of the rice (Oryza sativa) genome sequence revealed 34 full length MLEs (Osmars) belonging to 25 distinct families. This survey, which also identified sequence similarities between the Osmar elements and the Stowaway superfamily of MITEs, led to the formulation of a hypothesis whereby Stowaways are mobilized by OSMAR transposases. Here we investigate the DNA-binding activities and specificities of two OSMAR transposases, OSMAR5 and OSMAR10. Like other mariner-like transposases, the OSMARs bind specifically to the terminal inverted repeat (TIR) sequences of their encoding transposons. OSMAR5 binds DNA through a bipartite N-terminal domain containing two functionally separable helix-turn-helix motifs, resembling the paired domain of Tc1-like transposases and PAX transcription factors in metazoans. Furthermore, binding of the OSMARs is not limited to their own TIRs; OSMAR5 transposase can also interact in vitro with TIRs from closely related Osmar elements and with consensus TIRs of several Stowaway families mined from the rice genome sequence. These results provide the first biochemical evidence for a functional relationship between Osmar elements and Stowaway MITEs and lead us to suggest that there is extensive cross-talk among related but distinct transposon families co-existing in a single eukaryote genome.},

Like other MITEs, however, its origin and mode of amplification are poorly understood. Several lines of evidence point to plant mariner-like elements (MLEs) as the autonomous partners of the nonautonomous Stowaway MITEs. To better understand this relationship, we have taken advantage of the nearly complete genome sequences of two rice subspecies to generate the first inventory of virtually all MLEs and Stowaway families coexisting in a single plant species. Thirty-four different MLEs were found to group into three major clades and 25 families. More than 22,000 Stowaway MITEs were identified and classified into 36 families. On the basis of detailed sequence comparisons, MLEs were confirmed to be the best candidate autonomous elements for Stowaway MITEs. Surprisingly, however, sequence similarity between MLE and Stowaway families was restricted to the terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) and, in a few cases, to adjacent subterminal sequences. These data suggest a model whereby most of the Stowaway MITEs in rice were cross-mobilized by MLE transposases encoded by distantly related elements.},

Positive products were obtained for 6 dicots and 31 monocots of 54 plant species tested. Phylogenetic analysis of 68 distinct MLE transposase sequences from 25 grass species is consistent with vertical transmission and rapid diversification of multiple lineages of transposases. Surprisingly, the evolution of MLEs in grasses was accompanied by repeated and independent acquisition of introns in a localized region of the transposase gene.},

  Abstract                 = {The dependence with text length of the statistical properties of word occurrences has long been considered a severe limitation quantitative linguistics. We propose a simple scaling form for the distribution of absolute word frequencies which uncovers the robustness of this distribution as text grows. In this way, the shape of the distribution is always the same and it is only a scale parameter which increases linearly with text length. By analyzing very long novels we show that this behavior holds both for raw, unlemmatized texts and for lemmatized texts. For the latter case, the word-frequency distribution is well fit by a double power law, maintaining the Zipf's exponent value \$\backslash gamma\backslash simeq 2\$ for large frequencies but yielding a smaller exponent in the low frequency regime. The growth of the distribution with text length allows us to estimate the size of the vocabulary at each step and to propose an alternative to Heaps' law, which turns out to be intimately connected to Zipf's law, thanks to the scaling behavior.},

In this note, we reason that such claims are clearly unjustified, with the scaling law being clearly valid for absolute frequencies greater than about 10. Further, we show that the very counter-example provided by Yan and Minnhagen [arXiv:1404.1461] fulfils our scaling hypothesis with excellent accuracy, at odds with Yan and Minnhagen's criticisms, and supporting our approach.},

We show that a careful definition of Zipf's law leads to the violation of Heaps' law in random systems, and obtain alternative growth curves. These curves fulfill universal data collapses that only depend on the value of the Zipf's exponent. We observe that real books behave very much in the same way as random systems, despite the presence of burstiness in word occurrence. We advance an explanation for this unexpected correspondence.},

  Abstract                 = {DNA copy number variation has long been associated with specific chromosomal rearrangements and genomic disorders, but its ubiquity in mammalian genomes was not fully realized until recently. Although our understanding of the extent of this variation is still developing, it seems likely that, at least in humans, copy number variants (CNVs) account for a substantial amount of genetic variation. Since many CNVs include genes that result in differential levels of gene expression, CNVs may account for a significant proportion of normal phenotypic variation. Current efforts are directed toward a more comprehensive cataloging and characterization of CNVs that will provide the basis for determining how genomic diversity impacts biological function, evolution, and common human diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {DNA hybridization arrays simultaneously measure the expression level for thousands of genes. These measurements provide a "snapshot" of transcription levels within the cell. A major challenge in computational biology is to uncover, from such measurements, gene/protein interactions and key biological features of cellular systems. In this paper, we propose a new framework for discovering interactions between genes based on multiple expression measurements. This framework builds on the use of Bayesian networks for representing statistical dependencies. A Bayesian network is a graph-based model of joint multivariate probability distributions that captures properties of conditional independence between variables. Such models are attractive for their ability to describe complex stochastic processes and because they provide a clear methodology for learning from (noisy) observations. We start by showing how Bayesian networks can describe interactions between genes. We then describe a method for recovering gene in...},

Although the Abrams-Strogatz model for n=2 can be interpreted as modeling either majority preference or minority aversion, the two mechanisms are distinct when n>=3. We find that the condition for the coexistence of different states is independent of n under the pure majority preference, whereas it depends on n under the pure minority aversion. We also show that the stable coexistence equilibrium and stable monopoly equilibria can be multistable under the minority aversion and not under the majority preference. Furthermore, we obtain the phase diagram of the model when the effects of the majority preference and minority aversion are mixed, under the condition that different states have the same attractiveness. We show that the multistability is a generic property of the model facilitated by large n.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: DNA microarray experiments generating thousands of gene expression measurements, are being used to gather information from tissue and cell samples regarding gene expression differences that will be useful in diagnosing disease. We have developed a new method to analyse this kind of data using support vector machines (SVMs). This analysis consists of both classification of the tissue samples, and an exploration of the data for mis-labeled or questionable tissue results. Results: We demonstrate the method in detail on samples consisting of ovarian cancer tissues, normal ovarian tissues, and other normal tissues. The dataset consists of expression experiment results for 97802 cDNAs for each tissue. As a result of computational analysis, a tissue sample is discovered and confirmed to be wrongly labeled. Upon correction of this mistake and the removal of an outlier, perfect classification of tissues is achieved, but not with high confidence. We identify and analyse a subset of genes from the ovarian dataset whose expression is highly differentiated between the types of tissues. To show robustness of the SVM method, two previously published datasets from other types of tissues or cells are analysed. The results are comparable to those previously obtained. We show that other machine learning methods also perform comparably to the SVM on many of those datasets. Availability: The SVM software is available at http://www.cs.columbia.edu/\~{}bgrundy/svm.

  Abstract                 = {The evolution of human languages is driven both by primitive biases present in the human sensorimotor systems and by cultural transmission among speakers. However, whether the design of the language faculty is further shaped by linguistic biological biases remains controversial. To address this question, we used near-infrared spectroscopy to examine whether the brain activity of neonates is sensitive to a putatively universal phonological constraint. Across languages, syllables like blif are preferred to both lbif and bdif. Newborn infants (2-5 d old) listening to these three types of syllables displayed distinct hemodynamic responses in temporal-perisylvian areas of their left hemisphere. Moreover, the oxyhemoglobin concentration changes elicited by a syllable type mirrored both the degree of its preference across languages and behavioral linguistic preferences documented experimentally in adulthood. These findings suggest that humans possess early, experience-independent, linguistic biases concerning syllable structure that shape language perception and acquisition.},

Here, we make use of these data by investigating fluctuations in yearly usage frequencies of specific words that describe social and natural phenomena, as derived from books that were published over the course of the past two centuries. We show that the determination of the Hurst parameter by means of fractal analysis provides fundamental insights into the nature of long-range correlations contained in the culturomic trajectories, and by doing so offers new interpretations as to what might be the main driving forces behind the examined phenomena. Quite remarkably, we find that social and natural phenomena are governed by fundamentally different processes. While natural phenomena have properties that are typical for processes with persistent long-range correlations, social phenomena are better described as non-stationary, on-off intermittent or L\'{e}vy walk processes.},

  Abstract                 = {Oryza officinalis Wall. ex Watt. is an agriculturally important but seriously endangered species of wild rice. To obtain more accurate estimates of population structure for improved conservation planning of the species, genetic variability at 14 microsatellite DNA loci was examined in population samples covering most of the species' range in China. Considerable genetic variability (overall NaÂ =Â 1.886, PÂ =Â 62\%, HOÂ =Â 0.056, HEÂ =Â 0.216, and HSÂ =Â 0.277) was detected at the 14 loci in 442 individuals of the 18 natural populations. The evaluation of partitioning of genetic variability (FSTÂ =Â 0.442) suggested high genetic differentiation among the Chinese O. officinalis populations. An overall value of NmÂ =Â 0.316 suggested limited gene flow occurred among the sampled populations. Most of the populations showed heterozygote deficits in tests of Hardy2013Weinberg equilibrium and significantly positive FIS values. This could be due to some inbreeding occurring in this predominantly outcrossing species. For effective in situ conservation and restoration genetics, maintenance of significant historical processes is particularly important, including high outbreeding, considerable gene flow, and large population effective sizes. The high FST values detected among populations in this study are instructive for adopting a conservation plan that includes representative populations with the greatest genetic variation for either in situ conservation management or germplasm collection expeditions.},

Taking into account the frequency of word usage, we find that words with a positive emotional content are more frequently used. This lends support to Pollyanna hypothesis [3] that there should be a positive bias in human expression. We also find that negative words contain more information than positive words, as the informativeness of a word increases uniformly with its valence decrease. Our findings support earlier conjectures about (i) the relation between word frequency and information content, and (ii) the impact of positive emotions on communication and social links.},

Our case study builds on extensive data sets from the project's bug tracking platform Bugzilla, to quantify the activity of contributors, and its mail archives, to quantify the emotions of contributors by means of sentiment analysis. The Gentoo project is known for a considerable drop in development performance after the sudden retirement of a central contributor. We analyse how this event correlates with the negative emotions, both in bilateral email discussions with the central contributor, and at the level of the whole community of contributors. We then extend our study to consider the activity patters on Gentoo contributors in general. We find that contributors are more likely to become inactive when they express strong positive or negative emotions in the bug tracker, or when they deviate from the expected value of emotions in the mailing list. We use these insights to develop a Bayesian classifier that detects the risk of contributors leaving the project. Our analysis opens new perspectives for measuring online contributor motivation by means of sentiment analysis and for real-time predictions of contributor turnover in Open Source Software projects.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: We tackle the problem of finding regularities in microarray data. Various data mining tools, such as clustering, classification, Bayesian networks and association rules, have been applied so far to gain insight into gene-expression data. Association rule mining techniques used so far work on discretizations of the data and cannot account for cumulative effects. In this paper, we investigate the use of quantitative association rules that can operate directly on numeric data and represent cumulative effects of variables. Technically speaking, this type of quantitative association rules based on half-spaces can find non-axis-parallel regularities. Results: We performed a variety of experiments testing the utility of quantitative association rules for microarray data. First of all, the results should be statistically significant and robust against fluctuations in the data. Next, the approach should be scalable in the number of variables, which is important for such high-dimensional data. Finally, the rules should make sense biologically and be sufficiently different from rules found in regular association rule mining working with discretizations. In all of these dimensions, the proposed approach performed satisfactorily. Therefore, quantitative association rules based on half-spaces should be considered as a tool for the analysis of microarray gene-expression data.

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we combine statistical analysis of large text databases and simple stochastic models to explain the appearance of scaling laws in the statistics of word frequencies. Besides the sublinear scaling of the vocabulary size with database size (Heaps' law), here we report a new scaling of the fluctuations around this average (fluctuation scaling analysis). We explain both scaling laws by modeling the usage of words by simple stochastic processes in which the overall distribution of word-frequencies is fat tailed (Zipf's law) and the frequency of a single word is subject to fluctuations across documents (as in topic models). In this framework, the mean and the variance of the vocabulary size can be expressed as quenched averages, implying that: i) the inhomogeneous dissemination of words cause a reduction of the average vocabulary size in comparison to the homogeneous case, and ii) correlations in the co-occurrence of words lead to an increase in the variance and the vocabulary size becomes a non-self-averaging quantity. We address the implications of these observations to the measurement of lexical richness. We test our results in three large text databases (Google-ngram, Enlgish Wikipedia, and a collection of scientific articles).},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a stochastic model for the number of different words in a given database which incorporates the dependence on the database size and historical changes. The main feature of our model is the existence of two different classes of words: (i) a finite number of core-words which have higher frequency and do not affect the probability of a new word to be used; and (ii) the remaining virtually infinite number of noncore-words which have lower frequency and once used reduce the probability of a new word to be used in the future. Our model relies on a careful analysis of the google-ngram database of books published in the last centuries and its main consequence is the generalization of Zipf's and Heaps' law to two scaling regimes. We confirm that these generalizations yield the best simple description of the data among generic descriptive models and that the two free parameters depend only on the language but not on the database. From the point of view of our model the main change on historical time scales is the composition of the specific words included in the finite list of core-words, which we observe to decay exponentially in time with a rate of approximately 30 words per year.},

From a learnability point of view, functors might provide entry points or anchors into the syntactic structure of utterances due to their high frequency. Despite its potentially universal scope, this hypothesis has not yet been tested on typologically different languages and on populations of different ages. Here we report a corpus study and an artificial grammar learning experiment testing the anchoring hypothesis in Basque, Japanese, French, and Italian adults. We show that adults are sensitive to the distribution of functors in their native language and use them when learning new linguistic material. However, compared to infants' performance on a similar task, adults exhibit a slightly different behavior, matching the frequency distributions of their native language more closely than infants do. This finding bears on the issue of the continuity of language learning mechanisms.},

In this paper, we analyze how much information on the dynamics of innovation spreading can be obtained from a quantitative description of S-curves. We focus on the adoption of linguistic innovations for which detailed databases of written texts from the last 200 years allow for an unprecedent statistical precision. Combining data analysis with simulations of simple models (e.g., the Bass dynamics on complex networks) we identify signatures of endogenous and exogenous factors in the adoption curves. We propose a measure to quantify the strength of these factors and three different methods to estimate it from S-curves. We obtain cases in which the exogenous factors are dominant (in the adoption of German orthographic reforms and of one irregular verb) and cases in which endogenous factors are dominant (in the adoption of conventions for romanization of Russian names and in the regularization of most studied verbs). These results show that the shape of S-curve is not universal and contains information on the adoption mechanism.},

  Abstract                 = {The constant bombardment of mammalian genomes by transposable elements (TEs) has resulted in TEs comprising at least 45\% of the human genome. Because of their great age and abundance, TEs are important in comparative phylogenomics. However, estimates of TE age were previously based on divergence from derived consensus sequences or phylogenetic analysis, which can be unreliable, especially for older more diverged elements. Therefore, a novel genome-wide analysis of TE organization and fragmentation was performed to estimate TE age independently of sequence composition and divergence or the assumption of a constant molecular clock. Analysis of TEs in the human genome revealed \^{a}Ë†Â¼600,000 examples where TEs have transposed into and fragmented other TEs, covering >40\% of all TEs or \^{a}Ë†Â¼542 Mbp of genomic sequence. The relative age of these TEs over evolutionary time is implicit in their organization, because newer TEs have necessarily transposed into older TEs that were already present. A matrix of the number of times that each TE has transposed into every other TE was constructed, and a novel objective function was developed that derived the chronological order and relative ages of human TEs spanning >100 million years. This method has been used to infer the relative ages across all four major TE classes, including the oldest, most diverged elements. Analysis of DNA transposons over the history of the human genome has revealed the early activity of some MER2 transposons, and the relatively recent activity of MER1 transposons during primate lineages. The TEs from six additional mammalian genomes were defragmented and analyzed. Pairwise comparison of the independent chronological orders of TEs in these mammalian genomes revealed species phylogeny, the fact that transposons shared between genomes are older than species-specific transposons, and a subset of TEs that were potentially active during periods of speciation.},

  Abstract                 = {Human activities---from voter mobilization to political protests---increasingly take place in online environments, providing novel opportunities for relating individual behaviours to population-level outcomes. The recent availability of data sets that capture the behaviour of individuals participating in online social systems has driven the emerging field of computational social science, as large-scale empirical data sets enable the development of detailed computational models of individual and collective behaviour. Given the inherent limitations of observational data, it is crucial to investigate the extent to which models of collective dynamics can distinguish between different individual-level mechanisms. Here we introduce a simple generative model for the collective behaviour of millions of social networking site users who are deciding between different software applications. Our model incorporates two distinct components: one is associated with recent decisions of users, and the other reflects the cumulative popularity of each application. Importantly, although various combinations of the two mechanisms yield long-time behaviour that is consistent with data, only models that strongly emphasize recent popularity of applications over their cumulative popularity reproduce the observed temporal dynamics. Our approach demonstrates the value of even very simple generative models in understanding collective social behaviour, and it highlights the need to address temporal dynamics---not just long-time behaviour---when modelling complex social systems.},

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: This paper presents LASSAP, a new software package for sequence comparison. LASSAP is a programmable, high-performance system designed to raise current limitations of sequence comparison programs in order to fit the needs of large-scale analysis. LASSAP provides an API (Application Programming Interface) allowing the integration of any generic pairwise-based algorithm. RESULTS: Whatever pairwise algorithm is used in LASSAP, it shares with all other algorithms numerous enhancements such as: (i) intra- and inter-databank comparisons; (ii) computational requests (selections and computations are achieved on the fly); (iii) frame translations on queries and databanks; (iv) structured results allowing easy and powerful post-analysis; (v) performance improvements by parallelization and the driving of specialized hardware. LASSAP currently implements all major sequence comparison algorithms (Fasta, Blast, Smith/Waterman), and other string matching and pattern matching algorithms. LASSAP is both an integrated software for end-users and a framework allowing the integration and the combination of new algorithms. LASSAP is used in different projects such as the building of PRODOM, the exhaustive comparison of yeast sequences, and the subfragments matching problem of TREMBL.

  Abstract                 = {Semantic memory is the subsystem of human memory that stores knowledge of concepts or meanings, as opposed to life-specific experiences. How humans organize semantic information remains poorly understood. In an effort to better understand this issue, we conducted a verbal fluency experiment on 200 participants with the aim of inferring and representing the conceptual storage structure of the natural category of animals as a network. This was done by formulating a statistical framework for co-occurring concepts that aims to infer significant concept-concept associations and represent them as a graph. The resulting network was analyzed and enriched by means of a missing links recovery criterion based on modularity. Both network models were compared to a thresholded co-occurrence approach. They were evaluated using a random subset of verbal fluency tests and comparing the network outcomes (linked pairs are clustering transitions and disconnected pairs are switching transitions) to the outcomes of two expert human raters. Results show that the network models proposed in this study overcome a thresholded co-occurrence approach, and their outcomes are in high agreement with human evaluations. Finally, the interplay between conceptual structure and retrieval mechanisms is discussed.},

By collecting all Twitter messages written in Spanish over more than two years, we build a corpus from which a carefully selected list of concepts allows us to characterize Spanish varieties on a global scale. A cluster analysis proves the existence of well defined macroregions sharing common lexical properties. Remarkably enough, we find that Spanish language is split into two superdialects, namely, an urban speech used across major American and Spanish citites and a diverse form that encompasses rural areas and small towns. The latter can be further clustered into smaller varieties with a stronger regional character.},

  Abstract                 = {We present in this paper a numerical investigation of literary texts by various well-known English writers, covering the first half of the twentieth century, based upon the results obtained through corpus analysis of the texts. A fractal power law is obtained for the lexical wealth defined as the ratio between the number of different words and the total number of words of a given text. By considering as a signature of each author the exponent and the amplitude of the power law, and the standard deviation of the lexical wealth, it is possible to discriminate works of different genres and writers and show that each writer has a very distinct signature, either considered among other literary writers or compared with writers of non-literary texts. It is also shown that, for a given author, the signature is able to discriminate between short stories and novels.},

For each text, there were created time series representing length of sentences in words and analyzed its fractal properties using two methods of multifractal analysis: MFDFA and WTMM. Both methods showed that there are texts which can be considered multifractal in this representation but a majority of texts are not multifractal or even not fractal at all. Out of 30 books, only a few have so-correlated lengths of consecutive sentences that the analyzed signals can be interpreted as real multifractals. An interesting direction for future investigations would be identifying what are the specific features which cause certain texts to be multifractal and other to be monofractal or even not fractal at all.},

  Abstract                 = {We present results from our quantitative study of statistical and network properties of literary and scientific texts written in two languages: English and Polish. We show that Polish texts are described by the Zipf law with the scaling exponent smaller than the one for the English language. We also show that the scientific texts are typically characterized by the rank-frequency plots with relatively short range of power-law behavior as compared to the literary texts. We then transform the texts into their word-adjacency network representations and find another difference between the languages. For the majority of the literary texts in both languages, the corresponding networks revealed the scale-free structure, while this was not always the case for the scientific texts. However, all the network representations of texts were hierarchical. We do not observe any qualitative and quantitative difference between the languages. However, if we look at other network statistics like the clustering coefficient and the average shortest path length, the English texts occur to possess more clustered structure than do the Polish ones. This result was attributed to differences in grammar of both languages, which was also indicated in the Zipf plots. All the texts, however, show network structure that differs from any of the Watts-Strogatz, the Barabasi-Albert, and the Erdos-Renyi architectures.},

This retrieval is facilitated if one can infer the gist of a sentence, conversation, or document and use that gist to predict related concepts and disambiguate words. This article analyzes the abstract computational problem underlying the extraction and use of gist, formulating this problem as a rational statistical inference. This leads to a novel approach to semantic representation in which word meanings are represented in terms of a set of probabilistic topics. The topic model performs well in predicting word association and the effects of semantic association and ambiguity on a variety of language-processing and memory tasks. It also provides a foundation for developing more richly structured statistical models of language, as the generative process assumed in the topic model can easily be extended to incorporate other kinds of semantic and syntactic structure.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:In Archeae and Bacteria, the repeated elements called CRISPRs for "clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats" are believed to participate in the defence against viruses. Short sequences called spacers are stored in-between repeated elements. In the current model, motifs comprising spacers and repeats may target an invading DNA and lead to its degradation through a proposed mechanism similar to RNA interference. Analysis of intra-species polymorphism shows that new motifs (one spacer and one repeated element) are added in a polarised fashion. Although their principal characteristics have been described, a lot remains to be discovered on the way CRISPRs are created and evolve. As new genome sequences become available it appears necessary to develop automated scanning tools to make available CRISPRs related information and to facilitate additional investigations.DESCRIPTION:We have produced a program, CRISPRFinder, which identifies CRISPRs and extracts the repeated and unique sequences. Using this software, a database is constructed which is automatically updated monthly from newly released genome sequences. Additional tools were created to allow the alignment of flanking sequences in search for similarities between different loci and to build dictionaries of unique sequences. To date, almost six hundred CRISPRs have been identified in 475 published genomes. Two Archeae out of thirty-seven and about half of Bacteria do not possess a CRISPR. Fine analysis of repeated sequences strongly supports the current view that new motifs are added at one end of the CRISPR adjacent to the putative promoter.CONCLUSION:It is hoped that availability of a public database, regularly updated and which can be queried on the web will help in further dissecting and understanding CRISPR structure and flanking sequences evolution. Subsequent analyses of the intra-species CRISPR polymorphism will be facilitated by CRISPRFinder and the dictionary creator. CRISPRdb is accessible at http://crispr.u-psud.fr/crispr},

Since regulatory elements are frequently short and variable, their identification and discovery using computational algorithms is difficult. However, significant advances have been made in the computational methods for modeling and detection of DNA regulatory elements. The availability of complete genome sequence from multiple organisms, as well as mRNA profiling and high-throughput experimental methods for mapping protein-binding sites in DNA, have contributed to the development of methods that utilize these auxiliary data to inform the detection of transcriptional regulatory elements. Progress is also being made in the identification of cis-regulatory modules and higher order structures of the regulatory sequences, which is essential to the understanding of transcription regulation in the metazoan genomes. This article reviews the computational approaches for modeling and identification of genomic regulatory elements, with an emphasis on the recent developments, and current challenges.},

Much has changed since 1997. Suffix trees and close relatives are now widely taught in graduate level courses on computer algorithms and on bioinformatics; there are several good expositions on suffix tree algorithms and uses; the space requirements have been substantially reduced; machine memories have greatly increased; additional variants of suffix trees have been introduced that address some of their deficiencies; and suffix tree code is publicly available. As a result, and to some extent as a cause, there are now many more applications in bioinformatics of suffix trees and related data structures. The author addresses the wider uses of suffix trees in bioinformatics.},

  Abstract                 = {SA-Search is a web tool that can be used to mine for protein structures and extract structural similarities. It is based on a hidden Markov model derived Structural Alphabet (SA) that allows the compression of three-dimensional (3D) protein conformations into a one-dimensional (1D) representation using a limited number of prototype conformations. Using such a representation, classical methods developed for amino acid sequences can be employed. Currently, SA-Search permits the performance of fast 3D similarity searches such as the extraction of exact words using a suffix tree approach, and the search for fuzzy words viewed as a simple 1D sequence alignment problem. SA-Search is available at http://bioserv.rpbs.jussieu.fr/cgi-bin/SA-Search.},

We observe the process of nonlocal pattern formation that causes populations to self-organize into stable antagonistic groups as a result of the local dynamics of attraction and influence between individual computational agents. Our findings uncover some of the unique properties of opinion formation in social groups when the process is affected by asymmetric noise distribution, unstable intergroup boundaries, and different migratory behaviors. Although we focus on one particular study, the proposed stochastic dynamic models can be easily generalized and applied to investigate the evolution of other complex and nonlinear features of human collective behavior.},

More areas than Broca's and Wernicke's region are involved in language. Moreover, a division along the axis of language production and language comprehension does not seem to be warranted. Instead, for central aspects of language processing neural infrastructure is shared between production and comprehension. Three different accounts of the role of Broca's area in language are discussed. Arguments are presented in favor of a dynamic network view, in which the functionality of a region is co-determined by the network of regions in which it is embedded at particular moments in time. Finally, core regions of language processing need to interact with other networks (e.g. the attentional networks and the ToM network) to establish full functionality of language and communication.

  Abstract                 = {In the past 10 years, microbiology has undergone a revolution that has been driven by access to cheap high-throughput DNA sequencing. It was not long ago that the cloning and sequencing of a target gene could take months or years, whereas now this entire process has been replaced by a 10 min Internet search of a public genome database. There has been no single innovation that has initiated this rapid technological change; in fact, the core chemistry of DNA sequencing is the same as it was 30 years ago. Instead, progress has been driven by large sequencing centers that have incrementally industrialized the Sanger sequencing method. A side effect of this industrialization is that large-scale sequencing has moved out of small research labs, and the vast majority of sequence data is now generated by large genome centers. Recently, there have been advances in technology that will enable high-throughput genome sequencing to be established in research labs using bench-top instrumentation. These new technologies are already being used to explore the vast microbial diversity in the natural environment and the untapped genetic variation that can occur in bacterial species. It is expected that these powerful new methods will open up new questions to genomic investigation and will also allow high-throughput sequencing to be more than just a discovery exercise but also a routine assay for hypothesis testing. While this review will concentrate on microorganisms, many of the important arguments about the need to measure and understand variation at the species, population and ecosystem level will hold true for many other biological systems.},

  Abstract                 = {The vision of 'Smart Cities' is the urban center of the future, made safe, secure environmentally green, and efficient because all structures- whether for power, water, transportation, etc. are designed, constructed, and maintained making use of advanced, integrated materials, sensors, electronics, and networks which are interfaced with computerized systems comprised of databases, tracking, and decision-making algorithms. This paper discusses a current initiative being led by the Brookhaven National Laboratory to create a research, development and deployment agenda that advances this vision. This is anchored in the application of new technology to current urban center issues while looking 20 years into the future and conceptualizing a city framework that may exist.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: In detection of non-coding RNAs, it is often necessary to identify the secondary structure motifs from a set of putative RNA sequences. Most of the existing algorithms aim to provide the best motif or few good motifs, but biologists often need to inspect all the possible motifs thoroughly. Results: Our method RNAmine employs a graph theoretic representation of RNA sequences and detects all the possible motifs exhaustively using a graph mining algorithm. The motif detection problem boils down to finding frequently appearing patterns in a set of directed and labeled graphs. In the tasks of common secondary structure prediction and local motif detection from long sequences, our method performed favorably both in accuracy and in efficiency with the state-of-the-art methods such as CMFinder.

  Abstract                 = {This paper discusses the limitations of time-based equipment maintenance methods and the advantages of predictive or online maintenance techniques in identifying the onset of equipment failure. The three major predictive maintenance techniques, defined in terms of their source of data, are described as follows: 1) the existing sensor-based technique; 2) the test-sensor-based technique (including wireless sensors); and 3) the test-signal-based technique (including the loop current step response method, the time-domain reflectrometry test, and the inductance\&\#x2013;capacitance\&\#x2013;resistance test). Examples of detecting blockages in pressure sensing lines using existing sensor-based techniques and of verifying calibration using existing-sensor direct current output are given. Three Department of Energy (DOE)-sponsored projects, whose aim is to develop online and wireless hardware and software systems for performing predictive maintenance on critical equipment in nuclear power plants, DOE research reactors, and general industrial applications, are described.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Tandem repeats (TRs) are associated with human disease, play a role in evolution and are important in regulatory processes. Despite their importance, locating and characterizing these patterns within anonymous DNA sequences remains a challenge. In part, the difficulty is due to imperfect conservation of patterns and complex pattern structures. We study recognition algorithms for two complex pattern structures: variable length tandem repeats (VLTRs) and multi-period tandem repeats (MPTRs). Results: We extend previous algorithmic research to a class of regular tandem repeats (RegTRs). We formally define RegTRs, as well as two important subclasses: VLTRs and MPTRs. We present algorithms for identification of TRs in these classes. Furthermore, our algorithms identify degenerate VLTRs and MPTRs: repeats containing substitutions, insertions and deletions. To illustrate our work, we present results of our analysis for two difficult regions in cattle and human data which reflect practical occurrences of these subclasses in GenBank sequence data. In addition, we show the applicability of our algorithmic techniques for identifying Alu sequences, gene clusters and other distant regions of similarity. We illustrate this with an example from yeast chromosome I. Availability: Algorithms can be accessed at http://www.cs.wisc.edu/areas/theory Contact: kryder@cs.wisc.edu joseph@cs.wisc.edu},

  Abstract                 = {Novel high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies allow researchers to characterize a bacterial genome during a single experiment and at a moderate cost. However, the increase in sequencing throughput that is allowed by using such platforms is obtained at the expense of individual sequence read length, which must be assembled into longer contigs to be exploitable. This study focuses on the Illumina sequencing platform that produces millions of very short sequences that are 35 bases in length. We propose a de novo assembler software that is dedicated to process such data. Based on a classical overlap graph representation and on the detection of potentially spurious reads, our software generates a set of accurate contigs of several kilobases that cover most of the bacterial genome. The assembly results were validated by comparing datasets that were obtained experimentally for Staphylococcus aureus strain MW2 and Helicobacter acinonychis strain Sheeba with that of their published genomes acquired by conventional sequencing of 1.5 - 3.0 kb fragments. We also provide indications that the broad coverage achieved by high throughput sequencing might allow for the detection of clonal polymorphisms in the set of DNA molecules being sequenced.},

The availability of a significant amount of Lotus japonicus genome sequence has permitted for the first time a comprehensive study of the TE landscape in a legume species. Here we report the results of a combined computer-assisted and experimental analysis of the TEs in the 32.4 Mb of finished TAC clones. While computer-assisted analysis facilitated a determination of TE abundance and diversity, the availability of complete TAC sequences permitted identification of full-length TEs, which facilitated the design of tools for genomewide experimental analysis. In addition to containing all TE types found in previously characterized plant genomes, the TE component of L. japonicus contained several surprises. First, it is the second species (after Oryza sativa) found to be rich in Pack-MULEs, with >1000 elements that have captured and amplified gene fragments. In addition, we have identified what appears to be a legume-specific MULE family that was previously identified only in fungal species. Finally, the L. japonicus genome contains many hundreds, perhaps thousands of Sireviruses: Ty1/copia-like elements with an extra ORF. Significantly, several of the L. japonicus Sireviruses have recently amplified and may still be actively transposing.},

Nevertheless, still more data are needed, and more than anything a number of methodological problems need to be adressed. These problems, which are the focus of this paper. These questions will be addressed from two perspectives. The first perspective is an empirical one, where observations primarily derive from analyses of the data of Haspelmath et al. (2005). The second perspective is a computational one, where simulations are drawn upon to test the effects of different parameters on the development of structural linguistic diversity. The results suggest that there is indeed some hope that we may derive new empirical insights regarding linguistic prehistory by drawing upon typological data. We do not, however, make any specific empirical claims in this paper, but instead concentrate our efforts on methodology},

However, the relationships between the relative locations of remote orthologs over entire genomes have not been shown. Results: Comprehensive comparisons between the locations of orthologs on nineteen archaeal and bacterial genomes are presented by the location to location correspondence based on the gene-location distance. When the two genomes are rotated such that a pair of orthologs with the shortest distance is set in the same angle, a statistically significant number of orthologs maintain their relative locations between the genomes. Even by the short distances at the 5\% significance level, the rotations are restricted within a narrow range, suggesting an intrinsic angle for realizing similar locations between the orthologs in each genome pair. Furthermore, the rotations in the restricted range agree with the replication origin and terminus sites for the analyzed genomes where such sites are known. The relationship between location-maintained orthologs and gene function is also discussed. Contact: horimoto@post.saga-med.ac.jp},

We use Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA) to amplify the whole genome 10,000-fold directly from small amounts of whole blood, dried blood, buccal cells, cultured cells, and buffy coats specimens, generating large amounts of DNA for genetic testing. Genomic DNA was evenly amplified with complete coverage and consistent representation of all genes. All 47 loci analyzed from 44 individuals were represented in the amplified DNA at between 0.5- and 3.0-fold of the copy number in the starting genomic DNA template. A high-fidelity DNA polymerase ensures accurate representation of the DNA sequence. The amplified DNA was indistinguishable from the original genomic DNA template in 5 SNP and 10 microsatellite DNA assays on three different clinical sample types for 20 individuals. Amplification of genomic DNA directly from cells is highly reproducible, eliminates the need for DNA template purification, and allows genetic testing from small clinical samples. The low amplification bias of MDA represents a dramatic technical improvement in the ability to amplify a whole genome compared with older, PCR-based methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Complex genomes contain numerous repeated sequences, and genomic duplication is believed to be a main evolutionary mechanism to obtain new functions. Several tools are available for de novo repeat sequence identification, and many approaches exist for clustering homologous protein sequences. We present an efficient new approach to identify and cluster homologous DNA sequences with high accuracy at the level of whole genomes, excluding low-complexity repeats, tandem repeats and annotated interspersed repeats. We also determine the boundaries of each group member so that it closely represents a biological unit, e.g. a complete gene, or a partial gene coding a protein domain. Results: We developed a program called HomologMiner to identify homologous groups applicable to genome sequences that have been properly marked for low-complexity repeats and annotated interspersed repeats. We applied it to the whole genomes of human (hg17), macaque (rheMac2) and mouse (mm8). Groups obtained include gene families (e.g. olfactory receptor gene family, zinc finger families), unannotated interspersed repeats and additional homologous groups that resulted from recent segmental duplications. Our program incorporates several new methods: a new abstract definition of consistent duplicate units, a new criterion to remove moderately frequent tandem repeats, and new algorithmic techniques. We also provide preliminary analysis of the output on the three genomes mentioned above, and show several applications including identifying boundaries of tandem gene clusters and novel interspersed repeat families.

  Abstract                 = {Studies of language change have begun to contribute to answering several pressing questions in cognitive sciences, including the origins of human language capacity, the social construction of cognition and the mechanisms underlying culture change in general. Here, we describe recent advances within a new emerging framework for the study of language change, one that models such change as an evolutionary process among competing linguistic variants. We argue that a crucial and unifying element of this framework is the use of probabilistic, data-driven models both to infer change and to compare competing claims about social and cognitive influences on language change.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: The rapid accumulation of biological network data translates into an urgent need for computational methods for graph pattern mining. One important problem is to identify recurrent patterns across multiple networks to discover biological modules. However, existing algorithms for frequent pattern mining become very costly in time and space as the pattern sizes and network numbers increase. Currently, no efficient algorithm is available for mining recurrent patterns across large collections of genome-wide networks. Results: We developed a novel algorithm, CODENSE, to efficiently mine frequent coherent dense subgraphs across large numbers of massive graphs. Compared with previous methods, our approach is scalable in the number and size of the input graphs and adjustable in terms of exact or approximate pattern mining. Applying CODENSE to 39 co-expression networks derived from microarray datasets, we discovered a large number of functionally homogeneous clusters and made functional predictions for 169 uncharacterized yeast genes.

These novel families include a number of recently active full-length elements possessing identical long terminal repeats (LTRs) as well as intact gag and pol open reading frames.

The introduction of optimal spaced seeds in PatternHunter has increased both the sensitivity and the speed of homology search, and it has been adopted by many alignment programs such as BLAST. With the further improvement provided by multiple spaced seeds in PatternHunterII, Smith-Waterman sensitivity is approached at BLASTn speed. However, computing optimal multiple spaced seeds was proved to be NP-hard and current heuristic algorithms are all very slow (exponential). Results: We give a simple algorithm which computes good multiple seeds in polynomial time. Due to a completely different approach, the difference with respect to the previous methods is dramatic. The multiple spaced seed of PatternHunterII, with 16 weight 11 seeds, was computed in 12 days. It takes us 17 s to find a better one. Our approach changes the way of looking at multiple spaced seeds.

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

  Abstract                 = {Each relationship has its own personality. Almost immediately after a social interaction begins, verbal and nonverbal behaviors become synchronized. Even in asocial contexts, individuals tend to produce utterances that match the grammatical structure of sentences they have recently heard or read. Three projects explore language style matching (LSM) in everyday writing tasks and professional writing. LSM is the relative use of 9 function word categories (e.g., articles, personal pronouns) between any 2 texts. In the first project, 2 samples totaling 1,744 college students answered 4 essay questions written in very different styles. Students automatically matched the language style of the target questions. Overall, the LSM metric was internally consistent and reliable across writing tasks. Women, participants of higher socioeconomic status, and students who earned higher test grades matched with targets more than others did. In the second project, 74 participants completed cliffhanger excerpts from popular fiction. Judges' ratings of excerpt-response similarity were related to content matching but not function word matching, as indexed by LSM. Further, participants were not able to intentionally increase style or content matching. In the final project, an archival study tracked the professional writing and personal correspondence of 3 pairs of famous writers across their relationships. Language matching in poetry and letters reflected fluctuations in the relationships of 3 couples: Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning, and Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes. Implications for using LSM as an implicit marker of social engagement and influence are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved).},

Using natural language samples, we investigated whether similarity in dyads' use of function words, called language style matching (LSM), predicts outcomes for romantic relationships. In Study 1, greater LSM in transcripts of 40 speed dates predicted increased likelihood of mutual romantic interest (odds ratio = 3.05). Overall, 33.3\% of pairs with LSM above the median mutually desired future contact, compared with 9.1\% of pairs with LSM at or below the median. In Study 2, LSM in 86 couples' instant messages positively predicted relationship stability at a 3-month follow-up (odds ratio = 1.95). Specifically, 76.7\% of couples with LSM greater than the median were still dating at the follow-up, compared with 53.5\% of couples with LSM at or below the median. LSM appears to reflect implicit interpersonal processes central to romantic relationships.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, various methods are introduced for improving the ability of fuzzy classifier systems to automatically generate fuzzy if-then rules for pattern classification problems with continuous attributes. First, we describe a simple fuzzy classifier system where a randomly generated initial population of fuzzy if-then rules is evolved by typical genetic operations, such as selection, crossover, and mutation. By computer simulations on a real-world pattern classification problem with many continuous attributes, we show that the search ability of such a simple fuzzy classifier system is not high. Next, we examine the search ability of a hybrid algorithm where a learning procedure of fuzzy if-then rules is combined with the fuzzy classifier system. Then, we introduce two heuristic procedures for improving the performance of the fuzzy classifier system. One is a heuristic rule generation procedure for an initial population where initial fuzzy if-then rules are directly generated from training patterns. The other is a heuristic population update procedure where new fuzzy if-then rules are generated from misclassified and rejected training patterns, as well as from existing fuzzy if-then rules by genetic operations. By computer simulations, we demonstrate that these two heuristic procedures drastically improve the search ability of the fuzzy classifier system. We also examine a variant of the fuzzy classifier system where the population size (i.e., the number of fuzzy if-then rules) varies depending on the classification performance of fuzzy if-then rules in the current population},

  Abstract                 = {Fluid intelligence (Gf) refers to the ability to reason and to solve new problems independently of previously acquired knowledge. Gf is critical for a wide variety of cognitive tasks, and it is considered one of the most important factors in learning. Moreover, Gf is closely related to professional and educational success, especially in complex and demanding environments. Although performance on tests of Gf can be improved through direct practice on the tests themselves, there is no evidence that training on any other regimen yields increased Gf in adults. Furthermore, there is a long history of research into cognitive training showing that, although performance on trained tasks can increase dramatically, transfer of this learning to other tasks remains poor. Here, we present evidence for transfer from training on a demanding working memory task to measures of Gf. This transfer results even though the trained task is entirely different from the intelligence test itself. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the extent of gain in intelligence critically depends on the amount of training: the more training, the more improvement in Gf. That is, the training effect is dosage-dependent. Thus, in contrast to many previous studies, we conclude that it is possible to improve Gf without practicing the testing tasks themselves, opening a wide range of applications.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a novel approach for topological observability analysis using heuristic rule based expert system. The observability problem is split in P-/spl delta/ observability and Q-V observability by P-/spl delta//Q-V decouple characteristic of power systems. A heuristic rule based expert system is developed for finding the existence of an observable spanning tree for P-/spl delta/ measurement graph and Q-V measurement graph. This expert system finds the existence of an observable spanning tree in measurement graph on the basis of heuristic rules, directly without making a spanning tree. Inference in this approach is done by the process of chaining through rules until a conclusion about the observability or unobservability is reached. The proposed heuristic rule based expert system has been tested on the standard IEEE 5 bus and 14 bus test systems and an 87 bus real power system, which is a part of Northern grid network of India. Results obtained are presented for illustration.},

The resulting lexical chains are a means of identifying cohesive regions in a text, with applications in many natural language processing tasks, including text summarization. The first lexical chains were constructed manually using Rogets International Thesaurus. Morris and Hirst wrote that automation would be straightforward given an electronic thesaurus. All applications so far have used WordNet to produce lexical chains, perhaps because adequate electronic versions of Rogets were not available until recently. We discuss the building of lexical chains using an electronic version of Rogets Thesaurus. We implement a variant of the original algorithm, and explain the necessary design decisions. We include a comparison with other implementations.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Analysis of gene expression data can provide insights into the positive and negative co-regulation of genes. However, existing methods such as association rule mining are computationally expensive and the quality and quantities of the rules are sensitive to the support and confidence values. In this paper, we introduce the concept of positive and negative co-regulated gene cluster (PNCGC) that more accurately reflects the co-regulation of genes, and propose an efficient algorithm to extract PNCGCs. Results: We experimented with the Yeast dataset and compared our resulting PNCGCs with the association rules generated by the Apriori mining algorithm. Our results show that our PNCGCs identify some missing co-regulations of association rules, and our algorithm greatly reduces the large number of rules involving uncorrelated genes generated by the Apriori scheme.

  Abstract                 = {Segmental duplications (SD) play an important role in genome rearrangement, evolution and the copy-number variation (CNV) of primate genomes. Such sequences are difficult to detect, a priori, because they share no defining sequence features that distinguish them from unique portions of the genome. Current sequence annotation of segmental duplications requires computationally intensive, genome-wide self-comparisons that can not be easily implemented on new datasets. Based on the successful implementation of RepeatMasker, we developed a new genome annotation tool, DupMasker. The program uses a library of non-redundant consensus sequences of human segmental duplications, wherein a majority of the ancestral origins have been determined based on comparisons to mammalian outgroup genomes. Using DupMasker, new human and non-human primate (NHP) sequences may be readily queried to provide details on the origin and degree of sequence identity of each duplicon. This program can be applied to delineate the order and orientation of duplicons within complex duplication blocks and used to characterize structural variation differences between sequenced human haplotypes. We predict this tool will be valuable in the annotation of large-insert sequence clones, allowing putative unique and duplicated regions of the genomes to be annotated prior to whole genome assembly comparisons.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Identification and validation of a drug discovery target is a prominent step in drug development. In the post-genomic era it is possible to reevaluate the association of a gene with a specific biological function to see if a homologous gene can subsume this role. This concept has special relevance to drug discovery in human infectious diseases, like malaria. A trophozoite cysteine protease (falcipain-1) from the papain family, thought to be responsible for the degradation of erythrocyte hemoglobin, has been considered a promising target for drug discovery efforts owing to the antimalarial activity of peptide based covalent cysteine protease inhibitors. This led to the development of non-peptidic non-covalent inhibitors of falcipain-1 and their characterization as antimalarials. It is now clear from sequencing efforts that the malaria genome contains more than one cysteine protease and that falcipain-1 is not the most important contributor to hemoglobin degradation. Rather, falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 appear to account for the majority of cysteine hemoglobinase activity in the plasmodium trophozoite. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have modeled the falcipain-2 cysteine protease from one of the major human malaria species, Plasmodium falciparum and compared it to our original work on falcipain-1. As with falcipain-1, computa-tional screening of the falcipain-2 active site was conducted using DOCK. Using structural superpositions within the protease family and evolutionary analysis of substrate specificity sites, we focused on the commonalities and the protein specific features to direct our drug discovery effort. RESULTS: Since 1993, the size of the Available Chemicals Directory had increased from 55313 to 195419 unique chemical structures. For falcipain-2, eight inhibitors were identified with IC50's against the enzyme between 1 and 7 microM. Application of three of these inhibitors to infected erythrocytes cured malaria in culture, but parasite death did not correlate with food vacuole abnormalities associated with the activity of mechanistic inhibitors of cysteine proteases like the epoxide E64. CONCLUSIONS: Using plasmodial falcipain proteases, we show how a protein family perspective can influence target discovery and inhibitor design. We suspect that parallel drug discovery programs where a family of targets is considered, rather than serial programs built on a single therapeutic focus, will become the dominant industrial paradigm. Economies of scale in assay development and in compound synthesis are expected owing to the functional and structural features of individual family members. One of the remaining challenges in post-genomic drug discovery is that inhibitors of one target are likely to show some activity against other family members. This lack of specificity may lead to difficulties in functional assignments and target validation as well as a complex side effect profile.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Many of the most interesting functional and evolutionary relationships among proteins are so ancient that they cannot be reliably detected through sequence analysis and are apparent only through a comparison of the tertiary structures. The conserved features can often be described as structural motifs consisting of a few single residues or Secondary Structure (SS) elements. Confidence in such motifs is greatly boosted when they are found in more than a pair of proteins. Results: We describe an algorithm for the automatic discovery of recurring patterns in protein structures. The patterns consist of individual residues having a defined order along the protein's backbone that come close together in the structure and whose spatial conformations are similar. The residues in a pattern need not be close in the protein's sequence. The work described in this paper builds on an earlier reported algorithm for motif discovery. This paper describes a significant improvement of the algorithm which makes it very efficient. The improved efficiency allows us to use it for doing unsupervised learning of patterns occurring in small subsets in a large set of structures, a non-redundant subset of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database of all known protein structures.

The model uses simple convolution and superposition mechanisms (cf. B. B. Murdock, 1982) to learn distributed holographic representations for words. The structure of the resulting lexicon can account for empirical data from classic experiments studying semantic typicality, categorization, priming, and semantic constraint in sentence completions. Furthermore, order information can be retrieved from the holographic representations, allowing the model to account for limited word transitions without the need for built-in transition rules. The model demonstrates that a broad range of psychological data can be accounted for directly from the structure of lexical representations learned in this way, without the need for complexity to be built into either the processing mechanisms or the representations. The holographic representations are an appropriate knowledge representation to be used by higher order models of language comprehension, relieving the complexity required at the higher level.},

The analysis presented here indicates that repetitive elements in complete genomes may have been very important in the evolutionary genomics. In this study, a database, called the Repeat Sequence Database, is first designed and implemented to store complete and comprehensive repetitive sequences. See http://rsdb.csie.ncu.edu.tw for more information. The database contains direct, inverted and palindromic repetitive sequences, and each repetitive sequence has a variable length ranging from seven to many hundred nucleotides. The repetitive sequences in the database are explored using a mathematical algorithm to mine rules on how combinations of individual binding sites are distributed among repetitive sequences in the database. Combinations of transcription factor binding sites in the repetitive sequences are obtained and then data mining techniques are applied to mine association rules from these combinations. The discovered associations are further pruned to remove insignificant associations and obtain a set of associations. The mined association rules facilitate efforts to identify gene classes regulated by similar mechanisms and accurately predict regulatory elements. Experiments are performed on several genomes including C. elegans, human chromosome 22, and yeast.},

We present a corpus of email threads manually annotated with topics, and evaluate annotator reliabil- ity. To our knowledge, this is the first such email corpus. We show how the existing topic segmentation models (i.e., Lexical Chain Seg- menter (LCSeg) and Latent Dirichlet Alloca- tion (LDA)) which are solely based on lex- ical information, can be applied to emails. By pointing out where these methods fail and what any desired model should consider, we propose two novel extensions of the models that not only use lexical information but also exploit finer level conversation structure in a principled way. Empirical evaluation shows that LCSeg is a better model than LDA for segmenting an email thread into topical clus- ters and incorporating conversation structure into these models improves the performance significantly.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: The high content of repetitive sequences in the genomes of many higher eukaryotes renders the task of annotating them computationally intensive. Presently, the only widely accepted method of searching and annotating transposable elements (TEs) in large genomic sequences is the use of the RepeatMasker program, which identifies new copies of TEs by pairwise sequence comparisons with a library of known TEs. Profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been used successfully in discovering distant homologs of known proteins in large protein databases, but this approach has only rarely been applied to known model TE families in genomic DNA. Results:We used a combination of computational approaches to annotate the TEs in the finished genome of Oryza sativa ssp. japonica. In this paper, we discuss the strengths and the weaknesses of the annotation methods used. These approaches included: the default configuration of Repeat- Masker using cross\_match, an implementation of the Smithâ€“ Watermanâ€“Gotoh algorithm; RepeatMasker usingWU-BLAST for similarity searching; and the HMMER package, used to search for TEs with profile HMMs. All the results were converted into GFF format and post-processed using a set of Perl scripts. RepeatMasker was used in the case of most TE families. The WU-BLAST implementation of RepeatMasker was found to be manifold faster than cross\_match with only a slight loss in sensitivity and was thus used to obtain the final set of data. HMMER was used in the annotation of the Mutator-like element (MULE) superfamily and the miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) polyphyletic group of families, for which large libraries of elements were available and which could be divided into well-defined families. The HMMER search algorithm was extremely slow for models over 1000 bp in length, so MULE families with members over 1000 bp long were processed with RepeatMasker instead. The main disadvantage of HMMER in this application is that, since it was developed with protein sequences in mind, it does not search the negative DNA strand. With the exception of TE familieswith essentially palindromic sequences, reverse complement models had to be created and run to compensate for this shortcoming. We conclude that a modification of RepeatMasker to incorporate libraries of profile HMMs in searches could improve the ability to detect degenerated copies of TEs.

The selection of specific oligos to attach to the array surface is a relevant problem in the experiment design process. Given a set S of genomic sequences (the target sequences), the task is to find at least one oligonucleotide, called probe, for each sequence in S. This probe will be attached to the array surface, and must be chosen in a way that it will not hybridize to any other sequence but the intended target. Furthermore, all probes on the array must hybridize to their intended targets under the same reaction conditions, most importantly at the temperature T at which the experiment is conducted. Results: We present an efficient algorithm for the probe design problem. Melting temperatures are calculated for all possible probe-target interactions using an extended nearest-neighbor model, allowing for both non-Watson-Crick base-pairing and unpaired bases within a duplex. To compute temperatures efficiently, a combination of suffix trees and dynamic programming based alignment algorithms is introduced. Additional filtering steps during preprocessing increase the speed of the computation. The practicability of the algorithms is demonstrated by two case studies: The identification of HIV-1 subtypes, and of 28S rDNA sequences from [\&gt;=]400 organisms.

Results: We propose an efficient technique for local alignment of large genome strings. A space-efficient index is computed for one string, and the second string is compared with this index in order to prune substring pairs that do not contain similar regions. The remaining substring pairs are handed to a hash-table-based tool, such as BLAST, for alignment. A dynamic strategy is employed to optimize the number of disk seeks needed to access the hash table. Additionally, our technique provides the user with a coarse-grained visualization of the similarity pattern, quickly and before the actual search. The experimental results show that our technique aligns genome strings up to two orders of magnitude faster than BLAST. Our technique can be used to accelerate other search tools as well.

We describe a group of retrotransposons in 13 species and four genera of the grass tribe Triticeae, including barley, with long, [\~{}]4.4-kb LTRs formerly called Sukkula elements. The [\~{}]3.5-kb central domains include reverse transcriptase priming sites and are conserved in sequence but contain no open reading frames encoding typical retrotransposon proteins. However, they specify well-conserved RNA secondary structures. These features describe a novel group of elements, called LARDs or large retrotransposon derivatives (LARDs). These appear to be members of the gypsy class of LTR retrotransposons. Although apparently nonautonomous, LARDs appear to be transcribed and can be recombinationally mapped due to the polymorphism of their insertion sites. They are dispersed throughout the genome in an estimated 1.3 x 103 full-length copies and 1.16 x 104 solo LTRs, indicating frequent recombinational loss of internal domains as demonstrated also for the BARE-1 barley retrotransposon.},

Although a tendency for clustering was found common for the genes of interest, significant variations in gene order and the degree of clustering were uncovered both between and within different groups of Proteobacteria and between Proteobacteria and Planctomycetes. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the evolution of genes encoding H4MPT-linked reactions in Proteobacteria involved lateral transfers within Proteobacteria and possibly between Proteobacteria and other phyla. Gene cluster comparisons revealed a number of novel genes potentially involved in the C1 transfer reactions, and these were analyzed by mutation and expression analyses. Four genes, a homolog of pabB, and three genes conserved between methanogenic Archaea and Bacteria possessing H4MPT-linked functions, orfY, orf1, and afpA were shown to be involved in formaldehyde oxidation/detoxification, as judged by specific mutant phenotypes. In particular, pabB contributes to the biosynthesis of para-aminobenzoic acid, a precursor of both tetrahydrofolate and H4MPT, and afpA apparently encodes a novel dihydromethanopterin reductase, based on mutant complementation experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {Eukaryotes contain numerous transposable or mobile elements capable of parasite-like proliferation in the host genome. All known transposable elements in eukaryotes belong to two types: retrotransposons and DNA transposons. Here we report a previously uncharacterized class of DNA transposons called Polintons that populate genomes of protists, fungi, and animals, including entamoeba, soybean rust, hydra, sea anemone, nematodes, fruit flies, beetle, sea urchin, sea squirt, fish, lizard, frog, and chicken. Polintons from all these species are characterized by a unique set of proteins necessary for their transposition, including a protein-primed DNA polymerase B, retroviral integrase, cysteine protease, and ATPase. In addition, Polintons are characterized by 6-bp target site duplications, terminal-inverted repeats that are several hundred nucleotides long, and 5'-AG and TC-3' termini. Analogously to known transposable elements, Polintons exist as autonomous and nonautonomous elements. Our data suggest that Polintons have evolved from a linear plasmid that acquired a retroviral integrase at least 1 billion years ago. According to the model of Polinton transposition proposed here, a Polinton DNA molecule excised from the genome serves as a template for extrachromosomal synthesis of its double-stranded DNA copy by the Polinton-encoded DNA polymerase and is inserted back into genome by its integrase.},

Autonomous Helitrons encode a 5'-to-3' DNA helicase and nuclease/ligase similar to those encoded by known rolling-circle replicons. Helitron-like transposons have conservative 5'-TC and CTRR-3' termini and do not have terminal inverted repeats. They contain 16- to 20-bp hairpins separated by 10-12 nucleotides from the 3'-end and transpose precisely between the 5'-A and T-3', with no modifications of the AT target sites. Together with their multiple diverged nonautonomous descendants, Helitrons constitute [approx]2\% of both the Arabidopsis thaliana and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes and also colonize the Oriza sativa genome. Sequence conservation suggests that Helitrons continue to be transposed.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, the data from a large online collection is used to study variation in the vocabulary of Russian literary texts. First, we find that variation in the vocabulary size of different authors is in a good agreement with Heaps' law with parameter \$\backslash lambda=0.5\$, consistent with previous studies. The overall distribution of word frequencies has lighter tails than both the Zipf and lognormal laws predict. Next, we focus on the variation of word frequencies across texts. We confirm statistically that word frequencies vary significantly across texts, and find that the variance of the cross-text frequency distribution is in general higher for more frequent words. The dependence of the variance on the average word frequency follows a power law with exponent \$\backslash alpha=1.25.\$ The factor models applied to the data suggest that the most of the cross-text variation is concentrated in less than \$100\$ most frequent words and can be explained by about \$10\$ factors. For less-frequent words, the frequency data is more suitable for factor analysis if it is normalized to take into account the size of texts. The matrix of normalized frequencies for less-frequent words exhibit properties characteristic for a large random matrix deformed by a low-rank matrix. As an example of application, the spectral factors for the most frequent words are used to classify texts, and it is found that the k-means classification algorithm based on these factors can classify texts by authors with the accuracy that varied from about \$70\%\$ to \$90\%\$ for prose writers, and from \$60\%\$ to \$80\%\$ for poets.},

  Abstract                 = {Manual curation has long been held to be the "gold standard" for functional annotation of DNA sequence. Our experience with the annotation of more than 20,000 full-length cDNA sequences revealed problems with this approach, including inaccurate and inconsistent assignment of gene names, as well as many good assignments that were difficult to reproduce using only computational methods. For the FANTOM2 annotation of more than 60,000 cDNA clones, we developed a number of methods and tools to circumvent some of these problems, including an automated annotation pipeline that provides high-quality preliminary annotation for each sequence by introducing an "uninformative filter" that eliminates uninformative annotations, controlled vocabularies to accurately reflect both the functional assignments and the evidence supporting them, and a highly refined, Web-based manual annotation tool that allows users to view a wide array of sequence analyses and to assign gene names and putative functions using a consistent nomenclature. The ultimate utility of our approach is reflected in the low rate of reassignment of automated assignments by manual curation. Based on these results, we propose a new standard for large-scale annotation, in which the initial automated annotations are manually investigated and then computational methods are iteratively modified and improved based on the results of manual curation.},

Text and sequence-based searches provide quick and precise access to any region of specific interest. Secondary links from individual features lead to sequence details and supplementary off-site databases. One-half of the annotation tracks are computed at the University of California, Santa Cruz from publicly available sequence data; collaborators worldwide provide the rest. Users can stably add their own custom tracks to the browser for educational or research purposes. The conceptual and technical framework of the browser, its underlying MYSQL database, and overall use are described. The web site currently serves over 50,000 pages per day to over 3000 different users.},

Here we show that baby name dynamics is governed almost solely by deterministic forces, even though the emerging abundance statistics resembles the one obtained from a pure drift model. Exogenous events are shown to affect the name dynamics very rarely, and most of the year-to-year fluctuations around the deterministic trend may be attributed solely to demographic noise. We suggest that the rise and fall of a name reflect an "infection" process with delay and memory. The symmetry between adoption and abandonment speed emerges from our model without further assumptions.},

  Abstract                 = {SummaryObjective In this study, we aim at building a classification framework, namely the CARSVM model, which integrates association rule mining and support vector machine (SVM). The goal is to benefit from advantages of both, the discriminative knowledge represented by class association rules and the classification power of the SVM algorithm, to construct an efficient and accurate classifier model that improves the interpretability problem of SVM as a traditional machine learning technique and overcomes the efficiency issues of associative classification algorithms.Method In our proposed framework: instead of using the original training set, a set of rule-based feature vectors, which are generated based on the discriminative ability of class association rules over the training samples, are presented to the learning component of the SVM algorithm. We show that rule-based feature vectors present a high-qualified source of discrimination knowledge that can impact substantially the prediction power of SVM and associative classification techniques. They provide users with more conveniences in terms of understandability and interpretability as well.Results We have used four datasets from UCI ML repository to evaluate the performance of the developed system in comparison with five well-known existing classification methods. Because of the importance and popularity of gene expression analysis as real world application of the classification model, we present an extension of CARSVM combined with feature selection to be applied to gene expression data. Then, we describe how this combination will provide biologists with an efficient and understandable classifier model. The reported test results and their biological interpretation demonstrate the applicability, efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model.Conclusion From the results, it can be concluded that a considerable increase in classification accuracy can be obtained when the rule-based feature vectors are integrated in the learning process of the SVM algorithm. In the context of applicability, according to the results obtained from gene expression analysis, we can conclude that the CARSVM system can be utilized in a variety of real world applications with some adjustments.},

Such predictions may be used as an inexpensive tool to direct biological experiments. The increasing amount of available PPI data necessitates an accurate and scalable approach to protein complex identification. Results: We have developed the Restricted Neighborhood Search Clustering Algorithm (RNSC) to efficiently partition networks into clusters using a cost function. We applied this cost-based clustering algorithm to PPI networks of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans to identify and predict protein complexes. We have determined functional and graph-theoretic properties of true protein complexes from the MIPS database. Based on these properties, we defined filters to distinguish between identified network clusters and true protein complexes. Conclusions: Our application of the cost-based clustering algorithm provides an accurate and scalable method of detecting and predicting protein complexes within a PPI network.

Despite having lesser evidence strengths, it is inevitable to use computational methods for fast and a priori discovery of protein function annotations. This paper considers the problem of assigning Gene Ontology (GO) annotations to partially annotated or newly discovered proteins. Results: We present a data mining technique that computes the probabilistic relationships between GO annotations of proteins on protein-protein interaction data, and assigns highly correlated GO terms of annotated proteins to non-annotated proteins in the target set. In comparison with other techniques, probabilistic suffix tree and correlation mining techniques produce the highest prediction accuracy of 81\% precision with the recall at 45\%.

  Abstract                 = {'Smart cities' is a term that has gained traction in academia, business and government to describe cities that, on the one hand, are increasingly composed of and monitored by pervasive and ubiquitous computing and, on the other, whose economy and governance is being driven by innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship, enacted by smart people. This paper focuses on the former and, drawing on a number of examples, details how cities are being instrumented with digital devices and infrastructure that produce 'big data'. Such data, smart city advocates argue enables real-time analysis of city life, new modes of urban governance, and provides the raw material for envisioning and enacting more efficient, sustainable, competitive, productive, open and transparent cities. The final section of the paper provides a critical reflection on the implications of big data and smart urbanism, examining five emerging concerns: the politics of big urban data, technocratic governance and city development, corporatisation of city governance and technological lock-ins, buggy, brittle and hackable cities, and the panoptic city.

  Abstract                 = {We study the dynamics of public media attention by monitoring the content of online blogs. Social and media events can be traced by the propagation of word frequencies of related keywords. Media events are classified as exogenousâ€“where blogging activity is triggered by an external news itemâ€“or endogenous where word frequencies build up within a blogging community without external influences. We show that word occurrences exhibit statistical similarities to earthquakes. Moreover the size distribution of events scales with a similar exponent as found in the Gutenbergâ€“Richter law. The dynamics of media events before and after the main event can be satisfactorily modeled as a type of process which has been used to understand foreâ€“and aftershock rate distributions in earthquakesâ€“the Omori law. We present empirical evidence that for media events of endogenous origin the overall public reception of the event is correlated with the behavior of word frequencies at the beginning of the event, and is to a certain degree predictable. These results imply that the process of opinion formation in a human society might be related to effects known from excitable media.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies two spatial knowledge discovery problems involving proximity relationships between clusters and features. The first problem is: given a cluster of points, how can we efficiently find features (represented as polygons) that are closest to the majority of points in the cluster? We measure proximity in an aggregate sense due to the nonuniform distribution of points in a cluster (e.g. houses on a map), and the different shapes and sizes of features (e.g. natural or man-made geographic features). The second problem is: given n clusters of points, how can we extract the aggregate proximity commonalities (i.e. features) that apply to most, if not all, of the n clusters? Regarding the first problem, the main contribution of the paper is the development of Algorithm CRH (Circle, Rectangle and Hull), which uses geometric approximations (i.e. encompassing circles, isothetic rectangles and convex hulls) to filter and select features. The highly scalable and incremental Algorithm CRH can examine over 50,000 features and their spatial relationships with a given cluster in approximately one second of CPU time. Regarding the second problem, the key contribution is the development of Algorithm GenCom (Generalization for Commonality extraction) that makes use of concept generalization to effectively derive many meaningful commonalities that cannot be found otherwise},

  Abstract                 = {Although most LINEs (long interspersed nuclear elements), which are autonomous non-long-terminal-repeat retrotransposons, are inserted throughout the host genome, three groups of LINEs, the early-branched group, the Tx group, and the R1 clade, are inserted into specific sites within the target sequence. We previously characterized the sequence specificity of the R1 clade elements. In this study, we screened the other two groups of sequence-specific LINEs from public DNA databases, reconstructed elements from fragmented sequences, identified their target sequences, and analyzed them phylogenetically. We characterized 13 elements in the early-branched group and 13 in the Tx group. In the early-branched group, we identified R2 elements from sea squirts and zebrafish in this study, although R2 has not been characterized outside the arthropod group to date. This is the first evidence of cross-phylum distribution of sequence-specific LINEs. The Dong element also occurs across phyla, among arthropods and mollusks. In the Tx group, we characterized five novel sequence-specific families: Kibi for TC repeats, Koshi for TTC repeats, Keno for the U2 snRNA gene, Dewa for the tRNA tandem arrays, and Mutsu for the 5S rRNA gene. Keno and Mutsu insert into the highly conserved region within small RNA genes and destroy the targets. Several copies of Dewa insert different positions of tRNA tandem array, which indicates a certain "site specifier" other than sequence-specific endonuclease. In all three groups, LINEs specific for the rRNA genes or microsatellites can occur as multiple families in one organism. This indicates that the copy number of a target sequence is the primary factor to restrict the variety of sequence specificity of LINEs.},

In this paper, an efficient method for mining strong spatial association rules in geographic information databases is proposed and studied. A spatial association rule is a rule indicating certain association relationship among a set of spatial and possibly some nonspatial predicates. A strong rule indicates that the patterns in the rule have relatively frequent occurrences in the database and strong implication relationships. Several optimization techniques are explored, including a two-step spatial computation technique (approximate computation on large sets, and refined computations on small promising patterns), shared processing in the derivation of large predicates at multiple concept levels, etc. Our analysis shows that interesting association rules can be discovered efficiently in large spatial databases.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Separation of protein sequence regions according to their local information complexity and subsequent masking of low complexity regions has greatly enhanced the reliability of function prediction by sequence similarity. Comparisons with alternative methods that focus on compositional sequence bias rather than information complexity measures have shown that removal of compositional bias yields at least as sensitive and much more specific results. Besides the application of sequence masking algorithms to sequence similarity searches, the study of the masked regions themselves is of great interest. Traditionally, however, these have been neglected despite evidence of their functional relevance. Results: Here we demonstrate that compositional bias seems to be a more effective measure for the detection of biologically meaningful signals. Typical results on proteins are compared to results for sequences that have been randomized in various ways, conserving composition and local correlations for individual proteins or the entire set. It is remarkable that low-complexity regions have the same form of distribution in proteins as in randomized sequences, and that the signal from randomized sequences with conserved local correlations and amino acid composition almost matches the signal from proteins. This is not the case for sequence bias, which hence seems to be a genuinely biological phenomenon in contrast to patches of low complexity.

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Approximate tandem repeats (ATR) occur frequently in the genomes of organisms, and are a source of polymorphisms observed in individuals, and thus are of interest to those studying genetic disorders. Though extensive work has been done in order to identify ATRs, there are inherent limitations with the current approaches in terms of the number of pattern sizes that can be searched or the size of the input length. Results: This paper describes (1) a new algorithm which exhaustively finds all variable-length ATRs in a genomic sequence and (2) a precise description of, and an algorithm to significantly reduce, redundancy in the output. Our ATR definition is parameterized by a mismatch ratio p which allows for more mismatches in longer tandem repeats (and fewer in shorter). Furthermore, our algorithm is embarrassingly parallel and thus can attain near-linear speed-up on Beowulf clusters. We present results of our algorithm applied to sequences of widely differing lengths (from genes to chromosomes). Availability: Source and binaries are available on request.

  Abstract                 = {Organisms with a high density of transposable elements (TEs) exhibit nesting, with subsequent repeats found inside previously inserted elements. Nesting splits the sequence structure of TEs and makes annotation of repetitive areas challenging. We present TEnest, a repeat identification and display tool made specifically for highly repetitive genomes. TEnest identifies repetitive sequences and reconstructs separated sections to provide full-length repeats and, for long-terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, calculates age since insertion based on LTR divergence. TEnest provides a chronological insertion display to give an accurate visual representation of TE integration history showing timeline, location, and families of each TE identified, thus creating a framework from which evolutionary comparisons can be made among various regions of the genome. A database of repeats has been developed for maize (Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and barley (Hordeum vulgare) to illustrate the potential of TEnest software. All currently finished maize bacterial artificial chromosomes totaling 29.3 Mb were analyzed with TEnest to provide a characterization of the repeat insertions. Sixty-seven percent of the maize genome was found to be made up of TEs; of these, 95\% are LTR retrotransposons. The rate of solo LTR formation is shown to be dissimilar across retrotransposon families. Phylogenetic analysis of TE families reveals specific events of extreme TE proliferation, which may explain the high quantities of certain TE families found throughout the maize genome. The TEnest software package is available for use on PlantGDB under the tools section (http://www.plantgdb.org/prj/TE\_nest/TE\_nest.html); the source code is available from http://wiselab.org.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate properties of evolving linguistic networks defined by the word-adjacency relation. Such networks belong to the category of networks with accelerated growth but their shortest path length appears to reveal the network size dependence of different functional form than the ones known so far. We thus compare the networks created from literary texts with their artificial substitutes based on different variants of the Dorogovtsev-Mendes model and observe that none of them is able to properly simulate the novel asymptotics of the shortest path length. Then, we identify grammar induced local chain-like linear growth as a missing element in this model and extend it by incorporating such effects. It is in this way that a satisfactory agreement with the empirical result is obtained.},

The finaltranslation is obtained by consensus decodingthat combines hypotheses obtainedusing all bridge language word alignments.We present experiments showing that multilingual,parallel text in Spanish, French,Russian, and Chinese can be utilized inthis framework to improve translationperformance on an Arabic-to-English task.},

A model for writing process is proposed to explain the above difference, which takes into account the effects of finite vocabulary size. Experiments, simulations and analytical solution agree well with each other. The results show that the frequency distribution follows a power law with exponent being equal to 1, at which the corresponding Zipf's exponent diverges. Actually, the distribution obeys exponential form in the Zipf's plot. Deviating from the Heaps' law, the number of distinct words grows with the text length in three stages: It grows linearly in the beginning, then turns to a logarithmical form, and eventually saturates. This work refines previous understanding about Zipf's law and Heaps' law in language systems.},

Both the and sites appear to be polymorphic in maize, suggesting that these s have been active recently. s lack the strong predictive terminal features of other transposons, so the definition of their ends is greatly facilitated by the identification of their vacant sites in -minus lines. The ends of the 2.7-kb were discerned from a comparison of the McC haplotype sequence with that of yet a third line, Mo17, because the vacant site is deleted in B73. Maize s resemble rice Pack-MULEs in their ability to capture genes or gene fragments from several loci and move them around the genome, features that confer on them a potential role in gene evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4 out of the 10 leading causes of disability in the US and other developed countries are mental disorders. Major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are among the most common mental disorders that currently plague numerous countries and have varying incidence rates from 26 percent in America to 4 percent in China. Though some of this difference may be attributable to the manner in which individual healthcare providers diagnose mental disorders, this noticeable distribution can be also explained by studies which show that a lack of certain dietary nutrients contribute to the development of mental disorders. Notably, essential vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids are often deficient in the general population in America and other developed countries; and are exceptionally deficient in patients suffering from mental disorders. Studies have shown that daily supplements of vital nutrients often effectively reduce patients' symptoms. Supplements that contain amino acids also reduce symptoms, because they are converted to neurotransmitters that alleviate depression and other mental disorders. Based on emerging scientific evidence, this form of nutritional supplement treatment may be appropriate for controlling major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and anxiety disorders, eating disorders, attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD), addiction, and autism. The aim of this manuscript is to emphasize which dietary supplements can aid the treatment of the four most common mental disorders currently affecting America and other developed countries: major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Most antidepressants and other prescription drugs cause severe side effects, which usually discourage patients from taking their medications. Such noncompliant patients who have mental disorders are at a higher risk for committing suicide or being institutionalized. One way for psychiatrists to overcome this noncompliance is to educate themselves about alternative or complementary nutritional treatments. Although in the cases of certain nutrients, further research needs to be done to determine the best recommended doses of most nutritional supplements, psychiatrists can recommend doses of dietary supplements based on previous and current efficacious studies and then adjust the doses based on the results obtained.},

Many algorithms have been proposed so far, but none of them has been subjected to strict tests to evaluate their performance. Most of the sporadic tests performed so far involved small networks with known community structure and/or artificial graphs with a simplified structure, which is very uncommon in real systems. Here we test several methods against a recently introduced class of benchmark graphs, with heterogeneous distributions of degree and community size. The methods are also tested against the benchmark by Girvan and Newman and on random graphs. As a result of our analysis, three recent algorithms introduced by Rosvall and Bergstrom, Blondel et al. and Ronhovde and Nussinov, respectively, have an excellent performance, with the additional advantage of low computational complexity, which enables one to analyze large systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Much of human knowledge sits in large databases of unstructured text. Leveraging this knowledge requires algorithms that extract and record metadata on unstructured text documents. Assigning topics to documents will enable intelligent searching, statistical characterization, and meaningful classification. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is the state of the art in topic modeling. Here, we perform a systematic theoretical and numerical analysis that demonstrates that current optimization techniques for LDA often yield results that are not accurate in inferring the most suitable model parameters. Adapting approaches from community detection in networks, we propose a new algorithm that displays high reproducibility and high accuracy and also has high computational efficiency. We apply it to a large set of documents in the English Wikipedia and reveal its hierarchical structure.},

  Abstract                 = {Numerous studies indicate strong associations between languages and genes among human populations at the global scale, but all broader scale genetic and linguistic patterns must arise from processes originating at the community level. We examine linguistic and genetic variation in a contact zone on the eastern Indonesian island of Sumba, where Neolithic Austronesian farming communities settled and began interacting with aboriginal foraging societies approximately 3,500 years ago. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on a 200-word Swadesh list sampled from 29 localities supports the hypothesis that Sumbanese languages derive from a single ancestral Austronesian language. However, the proportion of cognates (words with a common origin) traceable to Proto-Austronesian (PAn) varies among language subgroups distributed across the island. Interestingly, a positive correlation was found between the percentage of Y chromosome lineages that derive from Austronesian (as opposed to aboriginal) ancestors and the retention of PAn cognates. We also find a striking correlation between the percentage of PAn cognates and geographic distance from the site where many Sumbanese believe their ancestors arrived on the island. These language-gene-geography correlations, unprecedented at such a fine scale, imply that historical patterns of social interaction between expanding farmers and resident hunter-gatherers largely explain community-level language evolution on Sumba. We propose a model to explain linguistic and demographic coevolution at fine spatial and temporal scales.},

Second, to introduce an algorithm to derive additional and implicit association rules, using an associated taxonomy, from the already discovered association rules},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: As more and more whole genomes are available, there is a need for new methods to compare large sequences and transfer biological knowledge from annotated genomes to related new ones. BLAST is not suitable to compare multimegabase DNA sequences. MegaBLAST is designed to compare closely related large sequences. Some tools to detect repeats in large sequences have already been developed such as MUMmer or REPuter. They also have time or space restrictions. Moreover, in terms of applications, REPuter only computes repeats and MUMmer works better with related genomes. Results: We present a heuristic method, named FORRepeats, which is based on a novel data structure called factor oracle. In the first step it detects exact repeats in large sequences. Then, in the second step, it computes approximate repeats and performs pairwise comparison. We compared its computational characteristics with BLAST and REPuter. Results demonstrate that it is fast and space economical. We show FORRepeats ability to perform intra-genomic comparison and to detect repeated DNA sequences in the complete genome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.

The DBpedia knowledge bases that are extracted from the other 110Wikipedia editions together consist of 1.46 billion facts and describe 10 million additional things. The DBpedia project maps Wikipedia infoboxes from 27 different language editions to a single shared ontology consisting of 320 classes and 1,650 properties. The mappings are created via a world-wide crowd-sourcing effort and enable knowledge from the differentWikipedia editions to be combined. The project publishes regular releases of all DBpedia knowledge bases for download and provides SPARQL query access to 14 out of the 111 language editions via a global network of local DBpedia chapters. In addition to the regular releases, the project maintains a live knowledge base which is updated whenever a page inWikipedia changes. DBpedia sets 27 million RDF links pointing into over 30 external data sources and thus enables data from these sources to be used together with DBpedia data. Several hundred data sets on theWeb publish RDF links pointing to DBpedia themselves and thus make DBpedia one of the central interlinking hubs in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud. In this system report, we give an overview of the DBpedia community project, including its architecture, technical implementation, maintenance, internationalisation, usage statistics and applications.

  Abstract                 = {We used conserved domains in the major class (nucleotide binding site plus leucine-rich repeat) of dicot resistance () genes to isolate related gene fragments via PCR from the monocot species rice and barley. Peptide sequence comparison of dicot genes and monocot -like genes revealed shared motifs but provided no evidence for a monocot-specific signature. Mapping of these genes in rice and barley showed linkage to genetically characterized genes and revealed the existence of mixed clusters, each harboring at least two highly dissimilar -like genes. Diversity was detected intraspecifically with wide variation in copy number between varieties of a particular species. Interspecific analyses of -like genes frequently revealed nonsyntenic map locations between the cereal species rice, barley, and foxtail millet although tight collinear gene order is a hallmark of monocot genomes. Our data suggest a dramatic rearrangement of gene loci between related species and implies a different mechanism for nucleotide binding site plus leucine-rich repeat gene evolution compared with the rest of the monocot genome.},

To help researchers digest the information in these documents, text mining tools are being developed that present co-occurrence relations between concepts. Statistical measures are used to mine interesting subsets of relations. We demonstrate how directionality of these relations affects interestingness. Support and confidence, simple data mining statistics, are used as proxies for interestingness metrics. We first built a test bed of 126,404 directional relations extracted from biomedical abstracts, which we represent as graphs containing a central starting concept and 2 rings of associated relations. We manipulated directionality in four ways and randomly selected 100 starting concepts as a test sample for each graph type. Finally, we calculated the number of relations and their support and confidence. Variation in directionality significantly affected the number of relations as well as the support and confidence of the four graph types.},

Iterating through definitions in this way, one typically finds that definitions loop back upon themselves. The graph formed by such definitional relations is our object of study. By eliminating those links which are not in loops, we arrive at a core subgraph of highly connected nodes. We observe that definitional loops are conveniently classified by length, with longer loops usually emerging from semantic misinterpretation. By breaking the long loops in the graph of the dictionary, we arrive at a set of disconnected clusters. We find that the words in these clusters constitute semantic units, and moreover tend to have been introduced into the English language at similar times, suggesting a possible mechanism for language evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Whole genome shotgun sequencing strategies generate sequence data prior to the application of assembly methodologies that result in contiguous sequence. Sequence reads can be employed to indicate regions of conservation between closely related species for which only one genome has been assembled. Consequently, by using pairwise sequence alignments methods it is possible to identify novel, non-repetitive, conserved segments in non-coding sequence that exist between the assembled human genome and mouse whole genome shotgun sequencing fragments. Conserved non-coding regions identify potentially functional DNA that could be involved in transcriptional regulation. Results: Local sequence alignment methods were applied employing mouse fragments and the assembled human genome. In addition, transcription factor binding sites were detected by aligning their corresponding positional weight matrices to the sequence regions. These methods were applied to a set of transcripts corresponding to 502 genes associated with a variety of different human diseases taken from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database. Using statistical arguments we have shown that conserved non-coding segments contain an enrichment of transcription factor binding sites when compared to the sequence background in which the conserved segments are located. This enrichment of binding sites was not observed in coding sequence. Conserved non-coding segments are not extensively repeated in the genome and therefore their identification provides a rapid means of finding genes with related conserved regions, and consequently potentially related regulatory mechanism. Conserved segments in upstream regions are found to contain binding sites that are co-localized in a manner consistent with experimentally known transcription factor pairwise co-occurrences and afford the identification of novel co-occurring Transcription Factor (TF) pairs. This study provides a methodology and more evidence to suggest that conserved non-coding regions are biologically significant since they contain a statistical enrichment of regulatory signals and pairs of signals that enable the construction of regulatory models for human genes.

Abstract: Co-words have been considered as carriers of meaning across different domains in studies of science, technology, and society. Words and co-words, however, obtain meaning in sentences, and sentences obtain meaning in their contexts of use. At the science/society interface, words can be expected to have different meanings: the codes of communication that provide meaning to words differ on the varying sides of the interface. Furthermore, meanings and interfaces may change over time. Given this structuring of meaning across interfaces and over time, we distinguish between metaphors and diaphors as reflexive mechanisms that facilitate the translation between contexts. Our empirical focus is on three recent scientific controversies: Monarch butterflies, Frankenfoods, and stem-cell therapies. This study explores new avenues that relate the study of co-word analysis in context with the sociological quest for the analysis and processing of meaning.},

By combining heuristic rules with mathematical algorithms, the proposed expert system is capable of optimizing the locations of substations and the conductor layout. A genetic algorithm approach is employed to determine the optimal sites of new substations. To determine the optimal conductor layout, a heuristic algorithm is proposed, which considers both the capital expenditure and the cost associated with power losses. The heuristic rules required in this expert system are also identified and reported in this paper. The expert system has been tested to be applicable and efficient.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Identification of protein complexes is crucial for understanding principles of cellular organization and functions. As the size of protein-protein interaction set increases, a general trend is to represent the interactions as a network and to develop effective algorithms to detect significant complexes in such networks.Results: Based on the study of known complexes in protein networks, this paper proposes a new topological structure for protein complexes, which is a combination of subgraph diameter (or average vertex distance) and subgraph density. Following the approach of that of the previously proposed clustering algorithm DPClus which expands clusters starting from seeded vertices, we present a clustering algorithm IPCA based on the new topological structure for identifying complexes in large protein interaction networks. The algorithm IPCA is applied to the protein interaction network of Sacchromyces cerevisiae and identifies many well known complexes. Experimental results show that the algorithm IPCA recalls more known complexes than previously proposed clustering algorithms, including DPClus, CFinder, LCMA, MCODE, RNSC and STM. Conclusions: The proposed algorithm based on the new topological structure makes it possible to identify dense subgraphs in protein interaction networks, many of which correspond to known protein complexes. The algorithm is robust to the known high rate of false positives and false negatives in data from high-throughout interaction techniques. The program is available at http://netlab.csu.edu.cn/bioinformatics/limin/IPCA.},

Previously, this spectrum is analyzed for more than 400 syllables without distinguishing the four intonations. In the current study, the spectrum with 1280 toned syllables is analyzed by logarithmic function, Beta rank function, and piecewise logarithmic function. Out of the three fitting functions, the two-piece logarithmic function fits the data the best, both by the smallest sum of squared errors (SSE) and by the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) value. The Beta rank function is the close second. By sampling from a Poisson distribution whose parameter value is chosen from the observed data, we empirically estimate the \$p\$-value for testing the two-piece-logarithmic-function being better than the Beta rank function hypothesis, to be 0.16. For practical purposes, the piecewise logarithmic function and the Beta rank function can be considered a tie.},

The beta rank function is even better than the logarithmic function judged by two measures of data-fitting performance: the sum of square errors, and Akaike information criterion. We comment on why the beta rank function is a good fitting function for many range-limited ranking data, whereas for range-open data it may be out-performed by other functions, such as a power-law function in the case of Zipfâ€™s law.},

Several challenging scientific tasks in the post-genomic epoch, like hunting for the genes underlying complex diseases from genome-wide gene expression profiles and thereby building the corresponding gene networks, are largely overlooked because of the lack of an efficient analysis approach. We have thus developed an innovative ensemble decision approach, which can efficiently perform multiple gene mining tasks. An application of this approach to analyze two publicly available data sets (colon data and leukemia data) identified 20 highly significant colon cancer genes and 23 highly significant molecular signatures for refining the acute leukemia phenotype, most of which have been verified either by biological experiments or by alternative analysis approaches. Furthermore, the globally optimal gene subsets identified by the novel approach have so far achieved the highest accuracy for classification of colon cancer tissue types. Establishment of this analysis strategy has offered the promise of advancing microarray technology as a means of deciphering the involved genetic complexities of complex diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {Automated evidence-based gene building is a rapid and cost-effective way to provide reliable gene annotations on newly sequenced genomes. One of the limitations of evidence-based gene builders, however, is their requirement for transcriptional evidence - known proteins, full-length cDNAs, or ESTs - in the species of interest. This limitation is of particular concern for plant genomes, where the rate of genome sequencing is greatly outpacing the rate of EST- and cDNA-sequencing projects. To overcome this limitation, we have developed an evidence-based gene build system (the Gramene pipeline) that can use transcriptional evidence across related species. The Gramene pipeline uses the Ensembl computing infrastructure with a novel data processing scheme. Using the previously annotated plant genomes, the dicot and the monocot , we show that the cross-species ESTs from within monocot or dicot class are a valuable source of evidence for gene predictions. We also find that, using only EST and cross-species evidence, the Gramene pipeline can generate a plant gene set that is comparable in quality to the human genes based on known proteins and full-length cDNAs. We compare the Gramene pipeline to several widely used ab initio gene prediction programs in rice; this comparison shows the pipeline performs favorably at both the gene and exon levels with cross-species gene products only. We discuss the results of testing the pipeline on a 22-Mb region of the newly sequenced maize genome and potential application of the pipeline to other genomes.},

A very successful means of inferring the structure or function of a previously unannotated protein is via sequence similarity with one or more proteins whose structure or function is already known. Toward this end, we propose a means of representing proteins using pairwise sequence similarity scores. This representation, combined with a discriminative classification algorithm known as the support vector machine (SVM), provides a powerful means of detecting subtle structural and evolutionary relationships among proteins. The algorithm, called SVM-pairwise, when tested on its ability to recognize previously unseen families from the SCOP database, yields significantly better performance than SVM-Fisher, profile HMMs, and PSI-BLAST.},

  Abstract                 = {Human language is based on grammatical rules. Cultural evolution allows these rules to change over time. Rules compete with each other: as new rules rise to prominence, old ones die away. To quantify the dynamics of language evolution, we studied the regularization of English verbs over the past 1,200 years. Although an elaborate system of productive conjugations existed in English's proto-Germanic ancestor, Modern English uses the dental suffix, '-ed', to signify past tense. Here we describe the emergence of this linguistic rule amidst the evolutionary decay of its exceptions, known to us as irregular verbs. We have generated a data set of verbs whose conjugations have been evolving for more than a millennium, tracking inflectional changes to 177 Old-English irregular verbs. Of these irregular verbs, 145 remained irregular in Middle English and 98 are still irregular today. We study how the rate of regularization depends on the frequency of word usage. The half-life of an irregular verb scales as the square root of its usage frequency: a verb that is 100 times less frequent regularizes 10 times as fast. Our study provides a quantitative analysis of the regularization process by which ancestral forms gradually yield to an emerging linguistic rule.},

  Abstract                 = {Lateral gene transfer (LGT) is considered as one of the drivers in bacterial genome evolution, usually associated with increased fitness and/or changes in behavior, especially if one considers pathogenic vs. non-pathogenic bacterial groups. The genomes of two phytopathogens, Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris and Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, were previously inspected for genome islands originating from LGT events, and, in this work, potentially early and late LGT events were identified according to their altered nucleotide composition. The biological role of the islands was also assessed, and pathogenicity, virulence and secondary metabolism pathways were functions highly represented, especially in islands that were found to be recently transferred. However, old islands are composed of a high proportion of genes related to cell primary metabolic functions. These old islands, normally undetected by traditional atypical composition analysis, but confirmed as product of LGT by atypical phylogenetic reconstruction, reveal the role of LGT events by replacing core metabolic genes normally inherited by vertical processes.},

  Abstract                 = {Horizontal gene transfer, a process through which genomes acquire sequences from distantly related organisms, is believed to be a major source of genetic diversity in bacteria. A central question concerning the impact of gene transfer on bacterial genome evolution is the proportion of horizontally transferred sequences within genomes. Through BLAST search, we found that the genomes of two phytopathogens, Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris and Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, have close to 40\% of the genes with the highest similarity to genes from phylogenetically distant organisms (non-gamma-proteobacteria). Most of these genes are found to be contiguous in the genome, forming genome islands, which may have been transferred from other organisms. Overall, the total number of genes within genome islands corresponds to almost one quarter of the entire xanthomonad genomes. Interestingly, many of the genes in these islands are functionally related to plant pathogenesis and virulence. Thus, these results suggest that horizontally transferred genes are clustered in the genome, and may facilitate fitness in new environments, as in the case of plant\^{a}â‚¬â€œbacteria interaction.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Multiple hypothesis testing is a common problem in genome research, particularly in microarray experiments and genomewide association studies. Failure to account for the effects of multiple comparisons would result in an abundance of false positive results. The Bonferroni correction and Holm's step-down procedure are overly conservative, whereas the permutation test is time-consuming and is restricted to simple problems. Results: We developed an efficient Monte Carlo approach to approximating the joint distribution of the test statistics along the genome. We then used the Monte Carlo distribution to evaluate the commonly used criteria for error control, such as familywise error rates and positive false discovery rates. This approach is applicable to any data structures and test statistics. Applications to simulated and real data demonstrate that the proposed approach provides accurate error control, and can be substantially more powerful than the Bonferroni and Holm methods, especially when the test statistics are highly correlated.

With appropriate combinations of major parameters of these networks, cluster analysis was able to distinguish the Slavic languages from the non-Slavic and correctly group the Slavic languages into their respective sub-branches. Moreover, the clustering could also capture the genetic relationships of some of these Slavic languages within their sub-branches.

However, this task is often difficult, slow, and idiosyncratic, especially when the sequences are highly diverged or include high rates of insertions and deletions (collectively known as indels). We present SAT\'{e} (simultaneous alignment and tree estimation), an automated method to quickly and accurately estimate both DNA alignments and trees with the maximum likelihood criterion. In our study, it improved tree and alignment accuracy compared to the best two-phase methods currently available for data sets of up to 1000 sequences, showing that coestimation can be both rapid and accurate in phylogenetic studies.},

Language and culture are intimately connected and linguists often use distinctive keywords to quantify the dynamics of information spreading in societies harboring strong culture centers. One prominent example, which is addressed here, is Kyotoâ€™s historical impact on Japanese culture. We construct a minimal model, based on shared properties of linguistic maps, to address the interplay between information flow and geography. We show that spreading of information over Japan in the premodern time can be described by an Eden growth process with noise levels corresponding to coherent spatial patches of sizes given by a single dayâ€™s walk (\~{}15 km), and that new words appear in Kyoto at times comparable to the time between human generations (\~{}30 yr).},

In response, other leading scholars agree that the reality of unconscious processes is no longer questionable. Although there is some disagreement about just how sophisticated these processes are, the consensus is that exciting times are ahead for both research and theory concerning the mental processes involved in unconscious cognition.},

  Abstract                 = {Genetic sequence alignment is the basis of many evolutionary and comparative studies, and errors in alignments lead to errors in the interpretation of evolutionary information in genomes. Traditional multiple sequence alignment methods disregard the phylogenetic implications of gap patterns that they create and infer systematically biased alignments with excess deletions and substitutions, too few insertions, and implausible insertion-deletion-event histories. We present a method that prevents these systematic errors by recognizing insertions and deletions as distinct evolutionary events. We show theoretically and practically that this improves the quality of sequence alignments and downstream analyses over a wide range of realistic alignment problems. These results suggest that insertions and sequence turnover are more common than is currently thought and challenge the conventional picture of sequence evolution and mechanisms of functional and structural changes.},

  Abstract                 = {Speech is a distinctive complex feature of human capabilities. In order to understand the physics underlying speech production, in this work we empirically analyse the statistics of large human speech datasets ranging several languages. We first show that during speech the energy is unevenly released and power-law distributed, reporting a universal robust Gutenberg-Richter-like law in speech. We further show that such earthquakes in speech show temporal correlations, as the interevent statistics are again power-law distributed. Since this feature takes place in the intra-phoneme range, we conjecture that the responsible for this complex phenomenon is not cognitive, but it resides on the physiological speech production mechanism. Moreover, we show that these waiting time distributions are scale invariant under a renormalisation group transformation, suggesting that the process of speech generation is indeed operating close to a critical point. These results are put in contrast with current paradigms in speech processing, which point towards low dimensional deterministic chaos as the origin of nonlinear traits in speech fluctuations. As these latter fluctuations are indeed the aspects that humanize synthetic speech, these findings may have an impact in future speech synthesis technologies. Results are robust and independent of the communication language or the number of speakers, pointing towards an universal pattern and yet another hint of complexity in human speech.},

The data indicate that the genome sizes of both and have increased substantially, >2\% and >6\%, respectively, since their divergence from a common ancestor, mainly because of the amplification of LTR-retrotransposons. However, losses of all classes of DNA sequence through unequal homologous recombination and illegitimate recombination have attenuated the growth of the rice genome. Small deletions have been particularly frequent throughout the genome. In >1 Mb of orthologous regions that we analyzed, no cases of complete gene acquisition or loss from either or were found, nor was any example of precise transposon excision detected. The sequences between genes were observed to have a very high rate of divergence, indicating a molecular clock for transposable elements that is at least 2-fold more rapid than synonymous base substitutions within genes. We found that regions prone to frequent insertions and deletions also exhibit higher levels of point mutation. These results indicate a highly dynamic rice genome with competing processes for the generation and removal of genetic variation.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Extraordinary size variation of higher plant nuclear genomes is in large part caused by differences in accumulation of repetitive DNA. This makes repetitive DNA of great interest for studying the molecular mechanisms shaping architecture and function of complex plant genomes. However, due to methodological constraints of conventional cloning and sequencing, a global description of repeat composition is available for only a very limited number of higher plants. In order to provide further data required for investigating evolutionary patterns of repeated DNA within and between species, we used a novel approach based on massive parallel sequencing which allowed a comprehensive repeat characterization in our model species, garden pea (Pisum sativum).RESULTS:Analysis of 33.3 Mb sequence data resulted in quantification and partial sequence reconstruction of major repeat families occurring in the pea genome with at least thousands of copies. Our results showed that the pea genome is dominated by LTR-retrotransposons, estimated at 140,000 copies/1C. Ty3/gypsy elements are less diverse and accumulated to higher copy numbers than Ty1/copia. This is in part due to a large population of Ogre-like retrotransposons which alone make up over 20\% of the genome. In addition to numerous types of mobile elements, we have discovered a set of novel satellite repeats and two additional variants of telomeric sequences. Comparative genome analysis revealed that there are only a few repeat sequences conserved between pea and soybean genomes. On the other hand, all major families of pea mobile elements are well represented in M. truncatula.CONCLUSION:We have demonstrated that even in a species with a relatively large genome like pea, where a single 454-sequencing run provided only 0.77\% coverage, the generated sequences were sufficient to reconstruct and analyze major repeat families corresponding to a total of 35-48\% of the genome. These data provide a starting point for further investigations of legume plant genomes based on their global comparative analysis and for the development of more sophisticated approaches for data mining.},

They are also re-configurable and include several types of probabilistic submodels which can be independently combined, such as Maximal Dependence Decomposition trees and interpolated Markov models.

  Abstract                 = {We are interested in detecting homologous genomic DNA sequences with the goal of locating approximate inverted, interspersed, and tandem repeats. Standard search techniques start by detecting small matching parts, called seeds, between a query sequence and database sequences. Contiguous seed models have existed for many years. Recently, spaced seeds were shown to be more sensitive than contiguous seeds without increasing the random hit rate. To determine the superiority of one seed model over another, a model of homologous sequence alignment must be chosen. Previous studies evaluating spaced and contiguous seeds have assumed that matches and mismatches occur within these alignments, but not insertions and deletions (indels). This is perhaps appropriate when searching for protein coding sequences (<5\% of the human genome), but is inappropriate when looking for repeats in the majority of genomic sequence where indels are common. In this paper, we assume a model of homologous sequence alignment which includes indels and we describe a new seed model, called indel seeds, which explicitly allows indels. We present a waiting time formula for computing the sensitivity of an indel seed and show that indel seeds significantly outperform contiguous and spaced seeds when homologies include indels. We discuss the practical aspect of using indel seeds and finally we present results from a search for inverted repeats in the dog genome using both indel and spaced seeds. Contact: dyfmak@bu.edu},

  Abstract                 = {A great deal of research exists on the neural basis of theory-of-mind (ToM) or mentalizing. Qualitative reviews on this topic have identified a mentalizing network composed of the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate/precuneus, and bilateral temporal parietal junction. These conclusions, however, are not based on a quantitative and systematic approach. The current review presents a quantitative meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies pertaining to ToM, using the activation-likelihood estimation (ALE) approach. Separate ALE meta-analyses are presented for story-based and nonstory-based studies of ToM. The conjunction of these two meta-analyses reveals a core mentalizing network that includes areas not typically noted by previous reviews. A third ALE meta-analysis was conducted with respect to story comprehension in order to examine the relation between ToM and stories. Story processing overlapped with many regions of the core mentalizing network, and these shared regions bear some resemblance to a network implicated by a number of other processes.},

In maize, gene-enrichment by copy-number normalization (high C0t) and methylation filtration (MF) have been used to generate up to two-fold coverage of the gene-space with less than 1 million sequencing reads. Simulations using sequenced bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones predict that 5Ã— coverage of gene-rich regions, accompanied by less than 1Ã— coverage of subclones from BAC contigs, will generate high-quality mapped sequence that meets the needs of geneticists while accommodating unusually high levels of structural polymorphism. By sequencing several inbred strains, we propose a strategy for capturing this polymorphism to investigate hybrid vigor or heterosis.},

Notably at the percolation threshold the semantic space is characterised by scale-free behaviour at different levels of complexity and this relates the semantic space to a wide range of biological, social and linguistics phenomena. In particular we find that the cluster size distribution, representing the size of different semantic areas, is scale-free. Moreover the topology of the resulting semantic space is scale-free in the connectivity distribution and displays small-world properties. However its statistical properties do not allow a classical interpretation via a generative model based on a simple multiplicative process. After giving a detailed description and interpretation of the topological properties of the semantic space, we introduce a stochastic model of content-based network, based on a copy and mutation algorithm and on the Heaps' law, that is able to capture the main statistical properties of the analysed semantic space, including the Zipf's law for the word frequency distribution.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary: BLAST programs often run on large SMP machines where multiple threads can work simultaneously and there is enough memory to cache the databases between program runs. A group of programs is described which allows comparable performance to be achieved with a Beowulf configuration in which no node has enough memory to cache a database but the cluster as an aggregate does. To achieve this result, databases are split into equal sized pieces and stored locally on each node. Each query is run on all nodes in parallel and the resultant BLAST output files from all nodes merged to yield the final output.

  Abstract                 = {The repetitive elements of medaka (Oryzias latipes) are poorly characterized in spite of recent rapid progress in the medaka genome analysis. Here we report the characterization of the repetitive elements in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I region, which spans about 400 kb and is one of the best characterized regions of the medaka genome. Microsatellite, low complexity regions, transposable elements, and other repeats occupied 0.68, 0.98, 7.0 and 2.9\%, respectively, of the MHC class I region. Eleven transposable elements, three LTR-type, six LINE-type and two DNA-type, including several novel ones, were identified. Genomic Southern hybridization analysis indicated that these LINE-type and DNA-type elements have many copies in the medaka genome, whereas the LTR-type elements have only several copies. The comparison of the medaka MHC class I region with those of zebrafish and fugu shows the presence of three medaka lineage-specific tandem duplications of the PSMB (proteasome [beta]-type subunit) 8 and class Ia genes. Since eight of the 11 transposable elements were located in this region, these elements may have played a role in the medaka-specific DNA rearrangement.},

  Abstract                 = {Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are undirected graphical models, a special case of which correspond to conditionally-trained finite state machines. A key advantage of CRFs is their great flexibility to include a wide variety of ar- bitrary, non-independent features of the input. Faced with this freedom, however, an important question remains: what features should be used? This paper presents an efficient feature induction method for CRFs. The method is founded on the principle of iteratively constructing feature conjunctions that would significantly increase conditional log-likelihood if added to the model. Automated feature induction enables not only improved accuracy and dramatic reduction in parameter count, but also the use of larger cliques, and more freedom to liberally hypothesize atomic input variables that may be relevant to a task. The method applies to linear-chain CRFs, as well as to more arbitrary CRF structures, such as Relational Markov Networks, where it corresponds to learning clique templates, and can also be understood as supervised structure learning. Experimental results on named entity extraction and noun phrase seg- mentation tasks are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons constitute a major fraction of the genomes of higher plants. For example, retrotransposons comprise more than 50\% of the maize genome and more than 90\% of the wheat genome. LTR retrotransposons are believed to have contributed significantly to the evolution of genome structure and function. The genome sequencing of selected experimental and agriculturally important species is providing an unprecedented opportunity to view the patterns of variation existing among the entire complement of retrotransposons in complete genomes.RESULTS:Using a new data-mining program, LTR\_STRUC, (LTR retrotransposon structure program), we have mined the GenBank rice (Oryza sativa) database as well as the more extensive (259 Mb) Monsanto rice dataset for LTR retrotransposons. Almost two-thirds (37) of the 59 families identified consist of copia-like elements, but gypsy-like elements outnumber copia-like elements by a ratio of approximately 2:1. At least 17\% of the rice genome consists of LTR retrotransposons. In addition to the ubiquitous gypsy- and copia-like classes of LTR retrotransposons, the rice genome contains at least two novel families of unusually small, non-coding (non-autonomous) LTR retrotransposons.CONCLUSIONS:Each of the major clades of rice LTR retrotransposons is more closely related to elements present in other species than to the other clades of rice elements, suggesting that horizontal transfer may have occurred over the evolutionary history of rice LTR retrotransposons. Like LTR retrotransposons in other species with relatively small genomes, many rice LTR retrotransposons are relatively young, indicating a high rate of turnover.},

They comprise about 8\% of the human genome and approximately 10\% of the mouse genome. On account of their abundance, LTR retrotransposons are believed to hold major significance for genome structure and function. Recent advances in genome sequencing of a variety of model organisms has provided an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate better the diversity of LTR retrotransposons resident in eukaryotic genomes.RESULTS:Using a new data-mining program, LTR\_STRUC, in conjunction with conventional techniques, we have mined the GenBank mouse (Mus musculus) database and the more complete Ensembl mouse dataset for LTR retrotransposons. We report here that the M. musculus genome contains at least 21 separate families of LTR retrotransposons; 13 of these families are described here for the first time.CONCLUSIONS:All families of mouse LTR retrotransposons are members of the gypsy-like superfamily of retroviral-like elements. Several different families of unrelated non-autonomous elements were identified, suggesting that the evolution of non-autonomy may be a common event. High sequence similarity between several LTR retrotransposons identified in this study and those found in distantly-related species suggests that horizontal transfer has been a significant factor in the evolution of mouse LTR retrotransposons.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons constitute a substantial fraction of most eukaryotic genomes and are believed to have a significant impact on genome structure and function. Conventional methods used to search for LTR retrotransposons in genome databases are labor intensive. We present an efficient, reliable and automated method to identify and analyze members of this important class of transposable elements. Results: We have developed a new data-mining program, LTR\_STRUC (LTR retrotransposon structure program) which identifies and automatically analyzes LTR retrotransposons in genome databases by searching for structural features characteristic of such elements. LTR\_STRUC has significant advantages over conventional search methods in the case of LTR retrotransposon families having low sequence homology to known queries or families with atypical structure (e.g. non-autonomous elements lacking canonical retroviral ORFs) and is thus a discovery tool that complements established methods. LTR\_STRUC finds LTR retrotransposons using an algorithm that encompasses a number of tasks that would otherwise have to be initiated individually by the user. For each LTR retrotransposon found, LTR\_STRUC automatically generates an analysis of a variety of structural features of biological interest. Availability: The LTR\_STRUC program is currently available as a console application free of charge to academic users from the authors. Contact: gm@uga.edu mcgene@uga.edu},

  Abstract                 = {Protein identification using mass spectrometry is an indispensable computational tool in the life sciences. A dramatic increase in the use of proteomic strategies to understand the biology of living systems generates an ongoing need for more effective, efficient, and accurate computational methods for protein identification. A wide range of computational methods, each with various implementations, are available to complement different proteomic approaches. A solid knowledge of the range of algorithms available and, more critically, the accuracy and effectiveness of these techniques is essential to ensure as many of the proteins as possible, within any particular experiment, are correctly identified. Here, we undertake a systematic review of the currently available methods and algorithms for interpreting, managing, and analyzing biological data associated with protein identification. We summarize the advances in computational solutions as they have responded to corresponding advances in mass spectrometry hardware. The evolution of scoring algorithms and metrics for automated protein identification are also discussed with a focus on the relative performance of different techniques. We also consider the relative advantages and limitations of different techniques in particular biological contexts. Finally, we present our perspective on future developments in the area of computational protein identification by considering the most recent literature on new and promising approaches to the problem as well as identifying areas yet to be explored and the potential application of methods from other areas of computational biology.},

This question is becoming crucial as we try to explain the emergent scale-free topology of the World Wide Web and use link analysis to identify important information resources. Existing models of growing information networks have focused on the structure of links but neglected the content of nodes. Here I show that the current models fail to reproduce a critical characteristic of information networks, namely the distribution of textual similarity among linked documents. I propose a more realistic model that generates links by using both popularity and content. This model yields remarkably accurate predictions of both degree and similarity distributions in networks of web pages and scientific literature.},

To gain global insight into the organization of its genome, we have sequenced the ends of large insert clones, yielding a cumulative length of one-eighth of the genome with a DNA sequence read every 6.2 kb, thereby describing a large percentage of the genes and transposable elements of maize in an unbiased approach. Based on the accumulative 307 Mb of sequence, repeat sequences occupy 58\% and genic regions occupy 7.5\%. A conservative estimate predicts \{approx\}59,000 genes, which is higher than in any other organism sequenced so far. Because the sequences are derived from bacterial artificial chromosome clones, which are ordered in overlapping bins, tagged genes are also ordered along continuous chromosomal segments. Based on this positional information, roughly one-third of the genes appear to consist of tandemly arrayed gene families. Although the ancestor of maize arose by tetraploidization, fewer than half of the genes appear to be present in two orthologous copies, indicating that the maize genome has undergone significant gene loss since the duplication event.},

  Abstract                 = {The Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS-GSF, Neuherberg, Germany) combines automatic processing of large amounts of sequences with manual annotation of selected model genomes. Due to the massive growth of the available data, the depth of annotation varies widely between independent databases. Also, the criteria for the transfer of information from known to orthologous sequences are diverse. To cope with the task of global in-depth genome annotation has become unfeasible. Therefore, our efforts are dedicated to three levels of annotation: (i) the curation of selected genomes, in particular from fungal and plant taxa (e.g. CYGD, MNCDB, MatDB), (ii) the comprehensive, consistent, automatic annotation employing exhaustive methods for the computation of sequence similarities and sequence-related attributes as well as the classification of individual sequences (SIMAP, PEDANT and FunCat) and (iii) the compilation of manually curated databases for protein interactions based on scrutinized information from the literature to serve as an accepted set of reliable annotated interaction data (MPACT, MPPI, CORUM). All databases and tools described as well as the detailed descriptions of our projects can be accessed through the MIPS web server (http://mips.gsf.de).},

Here we present an approach to systematically study similarity in the local structure of networks, based on the significance profile (SP) of small subgraphs in the network compared to randomized networks. We find several superfamilies of previously unrelated networks with very similar SPs. One superfamily, including transcription networks of microorganisms, represents "rate-limited" information-processing networks strongly constrained by the response time of their components. A distinct superfamily includes protein signaling, developmental genetic networks, and neuronal wiring. Additional superfamilies include power grids, protein-structure networks and geometric networks, World Wide Web links and social networks, and word-adjacency networks from different languages.},

Brain imaging studies have shown that different spatial patterns of neural activation are associated with thinking about different semantic categories of pictures and words (for example, tools, buildings, and animals). We present a computational model that predicts the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neural activation associated with words for which fMRI data are not yet available. This model is trained with a combination of data from a trillion-word text corpus and observed fMRI data associated with viewing several dozen concrete nouns. Once trained, the model predicts fMRI activation for thousands of other concrete nouns in the text corpus, with highly significant accuracies over the 60 nouns for which we currently have fMRI data.},

Over historical time, languages change dramatically and unpredictably by accumulation of small changes and by interaction with other languages. We have previously developed a mathematical model for the acquisition and evolution of language in heterogeneous populations of speakers. This model is based on game dynamical equations with learning. Here, we show that simple examples of such equations can display complex limit cycles and chaos. Hence, language dynamical equations mimic complicated and unpredictable changes of languages over time. In terms of evolutionary game theory, we note that imperfect learning can induce chaotic switching among strict Nash equilibria.},

  Abstract                 = {Publisher Summary The prime motivator in manufacturing is to keep production running in high gear. Maintenance directly affects the productivity, quality, and direct costs of production. Today, the most commonly practiced approach to maintenance continues to be purely reactive. This breakdown maintenance mentality stands in direct opposition to the target of high productivity. To keep production in high gearâ€”and to surviveâ€”manufacturers are increasingly obliged to move from a breakdown maintenance mindset towards a concept of proactive maintenance, organized around a well-trained staff. It is done within a carefully defined plan and with meaningful participation of employees, outside of what is normally thought of as traditional maintenance. It is a move towards a total team approach of effective preventive maintenance and total quality management. At the core of world-class maintenance is a new partnership among the manufacturing or production people, maintenance, engineering, and technical services to improve the overall equipment effectiveness. It is a program of zero breakdowns and zero defects aimed at improving or eliminating the six crippling shop-floor losses.},

Although a characterization of several aspects of our societies is emerging from the data revolution, a number of questions concerning the reliability and the biases inherent to the big data "proxies" of social life are still open. Here, we survey worldwide linguistic indicators and trends through the analysis of a large-scale dataset of microblogging posts. We show that available data allow for the study of language geography at scales ranging from country-level aggregation to specific city neighborhoods. The high resolution and coverage of the data allows us to investigate different indicators such as the linguistic homogeneity of different countries, the touristic seasonal patterns within countries and the geographical distribution of different languages in multilingual regions. This work highlights the potential of geolocalized studies of open data sources to improve current analysis and develop indicators for major social phenomena in specific communities.},

  Abstract                 = {We review some recent progress on the characterisation of long-range patterns of word use in language using methods from information theory. In particular, two levels of structure in language are considered. The first level corresponds to the patterns of words usage over different contextual domains. A direct application of information theory to quantify the specificity of words across different sections of a linguistic sequence leads to a measure of semantic information. Moreover, a natural scale emerges that characterises the typical size of semantic structures. Since the information measure is made up of additive contributions from individual words, it is possible to rank the words according to their overall weight in the total information. This allows the extraction of keywords most relevant to the semantic content of the sequence without any prior knowledge of the language. The second level considered is the complex structure of correlations among words in linguistic sequences. The degree of order in language can be quantified by means of the entropy. Reliable estimates of the entropy were obtained from corpora of texts from several linguistic families by means of lossless compression algorithms. The value of the entropy fluctuates across different languages since it depends on linguistic organisation at various levels. However, when a measure of relative entropy that specifically quantifies the degree of word ordering in language is estimated, it presents an almost constant value over all the linguistic families studied. This suggests that the entropy of word ordering is a novel quantitative linguistic universal.},

In written language, information is encoded by the concatenation of basic symbols under grammatical and semantic constraints. As is also the case in other natural information carriers, the resulting symbolic sequences show a delicate balance between order and disorder. That balance is determined by the interplay between the diversity of symbols and by their specific ordering in the sequences. Here we used entropy to quantify the contribution of different organizational levels to the overall statistical structure of language.},

Beyond the local order ruled by grammar, semantic and thematic structures affect long-range patterns in word usage. Here, we show that a direct application of information theory quantifies the relationship between the statistical distribution of words and the semantic content of the text. We show that there is a characteristic scale, roughly around a few thousand words, which establishes the typical size of the most informative segments in written language. Moreover, we find that the words whose contributions to the overall information is larger, are the ones more closely associated with the main subjects and topics of the text. This scenario can be explained by a model of word usage that assumes that words are distributed along the text in domains of a characteristic size where their frequency is higher than elsewhere. Our conclusions are based on the analysis of a large database of written language, diverse in subjects and styles, and thus are likely to be applicable to general language sequences encoding complex information.},

Here we review and extend recent results from quantitative characterisations of the degree of order in linguistic sequences that give insights into two relevant aspects of language: the presence of statistical universals in word ordering, and the link between semantic information and the statistical linguistic structure. We first analyse a measure of relative entropy that assesses how much the ordering of words contributes to the overall statistical structure of language. This measure presents an almost constant value close to 3.5 bits/word across several linguistic families. Then, we show that a direct application of information theory leads to an entropy measure that can quantify and extract semantic structures from linguistic samples, even without prior knowledge of the underlying language.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Cis-acting transcriptional regulatory elements in mammalian genomes typically contain specific combinations of binding sites for various transcription factors. Although some cis-regulatory elements have been well studied, the combinations of transcription factors that regulate normal expression levels for the vast majority of the 20,000 genes in the human genome are unknown. We hypothesized that it should be possible to discover transcription factor combinations that regulate gene expression in concert by identifying over-represented combinations of sequence motifs that occur together in the genome. In order to detect combinations of transcription factor binding motifs, we developed a data mining approach based on the use of association rules, which are typically used in market basket analysis. We scored each segment of the genome for the presence or absence of each of 83 transcription factor binding motifs, then used association rule mining algorithms to mine this dataset, thus identifying frequently occurring pairs of distinct motifs within a segment.RESULTS:Support for most pairs of transcription factor binding motifs was highly correlated across different chromosomes although pair significance varied. Known true positive motif pairs showed higher association rule support, confidence, and significance than background. Our subsets of high-confidence, high-significance mined pairs of transcription factors showed enrichment for co-citation in PubMed abstracts relative to all pairs, and the predicted associations were often readily verifiable in the literature.CONCLUSION:Functional elements in the genome where transcription factors bind to regulate expression in a combinatorial manner are more likely to be predicted by identifying statistically and biologically significant combinations of transcription factor binding motifs than by simply scanning the genome for the occurrence of binding sites for a single transcription factor.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: During evolution, functional regions in genomic sequences tend to be more highly conserved than randomly mutating junk DNA' so local sequence similarity often indicates biological functionality. This fact can be used to identify functional elements in large eukaryotic DNA sequences by cross-species sequence comparison. In recent years, several gene-prediction methods have been proposed that work by comparing anonymous genomic sequences, for example from human and mouse. The main advantage of these methods is that they are based on simple and generally applicable measures of (local) sequence similarity; unlike standard gene-finding approaches they do not depend on species-specific training data or on the presence of cognate genes in data bases. As all comparative sequence-analysis methods, the new comparative gene-finding approaches critically rely on the quality of the underlying sequence alignments. Results: Herein, we describe a new implementation of the sequence-alignment program DIALIGN that has been developed for alignment of large genomic sequences. We compare our method to the alignment programs PipMaker, WABA and BLAST and we show that local similarities identified by these programs are highly correlated to protein-coding regions. In our test runs, PipMaker was the most sensitive method while DIALIGN was most specific.

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Matches to repetitive sequences are usually undesirable in the output of DNA database searches. Repetitive sequences need not be matched to a query, if they can be masked in the database. RepeatMasker/Maskeraid (RM), currently the most widely used software for DNA sequence masking, is slow and requires a library of repetitive template sequences, such as a manually curated RepBase library, that may not exist for newly sequenced genomes. Results: We have developed a software tool called WindowMasker (WM) that identifies and masks highly repetitive DNA sequences in a genome, using only the sequence of the genome itself. WM is orders of magnitude faster than RM because WM uses a few linear-time scans of the genome sequence, rather than local alignment methods that compare each library sequence with each piece of the genome. We validate WM by comparing BLAST outputs from large sets of queries applied to two versions of the same genome, one masked by WM, and the other masked by RM. Even for genomes such as the human genome, where a good RepBase library is available, searching the database as masked with WM yields more matches that are apparently non-repetitive and fewer matches to repetitive sequences. We show that these results hold for transcribed regions as well. WM also performs well on genomes for which much of the sequence was in draft form at the time of the analysis. Availability: WM is included in the NCBI C++ toolkit. The source code for the entire toolkit is available at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/toolbox/ncbi\_tools++/CURRENT/. Once the toolkit source is unpacked, the instructions for building WindowMasker application in the UNIX environment can be found in file src/app/winmasker/README.build.

  Abstract                 = {Early psychiatry investigated dreams to understand psychopathologies. Contemporary psychiatry, which neglects dreams, has been criticized for lack of objectivity. In search of quantitative insight into the structure of psychotic speech, we investigated speech graph attributes (SGA) in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder type I, and non-psychotic controls as they reported waking and dream contents. Schizophrenic subjects spoke with reduced connectivity, in tight correlation with negative and cognitive symptoms measured by standard psychometric scales. Bipolar and control subjects were undistinguishable by waking reports, but in dream reports bipolar subjects showed significantly less connectivity. Dream-related SGA outperformed psychometric scores or waking-related data for group sorting. Altogether, the results indicate that online and offline processing, the two most fundamental modes of brain operation, produce nearly opposite effects on recollections: While dreaming exposes differences in the mnemonic records across individuals, waking dampens distinctions. The results also demonstrate the feasibility of the differential diagnosis of psychosis based on the analysis of dream graphs, pointing to a fast, low-cost and language-invariant tool for psychiatric diagnosis and the objective search for biomarkers. The Freudian notion that "dreams are the royal road to the unconscious" is clinically useful, after all.},

  Abstract                 = {Human languages evolve continuously, and a puzzling problem is how to reconcile the apparent robustness of most of the deep linguistic structures we use with the evidence that they undergo possibly slow, yet ceaseless, changes. Is the state in which we observe languages today closer to what would be a dynamical attractor with statistically stationary properties or rather closer to a non-steady state slowly evolving in time? Here we address this question in the framework of the emergence of shared linguistic categories in a population of individuals interacting through language games. The observed emerging asymptotic categorization, which has been previously tested--with success--against experimental data from human languages, corresponds to a metastable state where global shifts are always possible but progressively more unlikely and the response properties depend on the age of the system. This aging mechanism exhibits striking quantitative analogies to what is observed in the statistical mechanics of glassy systems. We argue that this can be a general scenario in language dynamics where shared linguistic conventions would not emerge as attractors, but rather as metastable states.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the most basic properties of the communicative sign is its dual nature. That is, a sign is a twofold entity composed of a formal component, which we call signal, and a referential component, namely a reference. Based on this conception, we say that a referent is coded in a particular sign, or that a sign is decoded in a particular referent. In selective scenarios it is crucial for the success of any adaptive innovation or communicative exchange that, if a particular referent a is coded in a particular signal s during the coding process, then the referent a is decoded from the sign s during the decoding process. In other words the referentiality of a signal must be preserved after being decoded, due to a selective pressure. Despite the information-theoretic flavour of this requirement, an inquiry into classical concepts of information theory such as entropy or mutual information will lead us to the conclusion that information theory as usually stated does not account for this very important requirement that natural communication systems must satisfy. Motivated by the relevance of the preservation of referentiality in evolution, we will fill this gap from a theoretical viewpoint, by deriving the consistent information conveyed from an arbitrary coding agent \$A\^{}v\$ to an arbitrary decoding agent \$A\^{}u\$ and discussing several of its interesting properties.},

This process is based on three major steps: the selection and preparation of data, the data mining operation, and finally the interpretation of the extracted units. The process may take advantage of domain knowledge embedded in domain ontologies, that may be used at every step of the KDD process. In the following, we detail three symbolic methods for KDD, i.e. lattice-based classification, frequent itemset search and association rule extraction. Then, we present three applications of the KDD process, and we end this research report with a discussion on the the main characteristics of the KDD process.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a lysophospholipid, is involved in various cellular processes such as migration, proliferation, and survival. To date, the impact of S1P on human glioblastoma is not fully understood. Particularly, the concerted role played by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and S1P in aggressive tumor behavior and angiogenesis remains to be elucidated.RESULTS:To gain new insights in the effect of S1P on angiogenesis and invasion of this type of malignant tumor, we used microarrays to investigate the gene expression in glioblastoma as a response to S1P administration in vitro. We compared the expression profiles for the same cell lines under the influence of epidermal growth factor (EGF), an important growth factor. We found a set of 72 genes that are significantly differentially expressed as a unique response to S1P. Based on the result of mining full-text articles from 20 scientific journals in the field of cancer research published over a period of five years, we inferred gene-gene interaction networks for these 72 differentially expressed genes. Among the generated networks, we identified a particularly interesting one. It describes a cascading event, triggered by S1P, leading to the transactivation of MMP-9 via neuregulin-1 (NRG-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). This interaction network has the potential to shed new light on our understanding of the role played by MMP-9 in invasive glioblastomas.CONCLUSION:Automated extraction of information from biological literature promises to play an increasingly important role in biological knowledge discovery. This is particularly true for high-throughput approaches, such as microarrays, and for combining and integrating data from different sources. Text mining may hold the key to unraveling previously unknown relationships between biological entities and could develop into an indispensable instrument in the process of formulating novel and potentially promising hypotheses.},

  Abstract                 = {Bioinformaticians have developed large collections of tools to make sense of the rapidly growing pool of molecular biological data. Biological systems tend to be complex and in order to understand them, it is often necessary to link many data sets and use more than one tool. Therefore, bioinformaticians have experimented with several strategies to try to integrate data sets and tools. Owing to the lack of standards for data sets and the interfaces of the tools this is not a trivial task. Over the past few years building services with web-based interfaces has become a popular way of sharing the data and tools that have resulted from many bioinformatics projects. This paper discusses the interoperability problem and how web services are being used to try to solve it, resulting in the evolution of tools with web interfaces from HTML/web form-based tools not suited for automatic workflow generation to a dynamic network of XML-based web services that can easily be used to create pipelines.},

  Abstract                 = {The concept of Smart City (SC) as a means to enhance the life quality of citizen has been gaining increasing importance in the agendas of policy makers. However, a shared definition of SC is not available and it is hard to identify common global trends. This paper provides with a comprehensive understanding of the notion of SC through the elaboration of a taxonomy of pertinent application domains, namely: natural resources and energy, transport and mobility, buildings, living, government, and economy and people. It also explores the diffusion of smart initiatives via an empirical study aimed at investigating the ratio of domains covered by a city's best practices to the total of potential domains of smart initiatives and at understanding the role that various economic, urban, demographic, and geographical variables might have in influencing the planning approach to create a smarter city. Results reveal that the evolution patterns of a SC highly depend on its local context factors. In particular, economic development and structural urban variables are likely to influence a city's digital path, the geographical location to affect the SC strategy, and density of population, with its associated congestion problems, might an important component to determine the routes for the SC implementation. This work provides policy makers and city managers with useful guidelines to define and drive their SC strategy and planning actions towards the most appropriate domains of implementation. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

One hundred forty-one lower socioeconomic status preschoolers enrolled in a Head Start program were randomly assigned to the training program, Head Start alone, or an active control group. Electrophysiological measures of children's brain functions supporting selective attention, standardized measures of cognition, and parent-reported child behaviors all favored children in the treatment program relative to both control groups. Positive changes were also observed in the parents themselves. Effect sizes ranged from one-quarter to half of a standard deviation. These results lend impetus to the further development and broader implementation of evidence-based education programs that target at-risk families.},

  Abstract                 = {Since language is tied to cognition, we expect the linguistic structures to reflect patterns we encounter in nature and analyzed by physics. Within this realm we investigate the process of protolanguage acquisition, using analytical and tractable methods developed within physics. A protolanguage is a mapping between sounds and objects (or concepts) of the perceived world. This mapping is represented by a matrix and the linguistic interaction among individuals is described by a random matrix model. There are two essential parameters in our approach. The strength of the linguistic interaction \$\backslash beta\$, which following Chomsky's tradition, we consider as a genetically determined ability, and the number \$N\$ of employed sounds (the lexicon size). Our model of linguistic interaction is analytically studied using methods of statistical physics and simulated by Monte Carlo techniques. The analysis reveals an intricate relationship between the innate propensity for language acquisition \$\backslash beta\$ and the lexicon size \$N\$, \$N \backslash sim \backslash exp(\backslash beta)\$. Thus a small increase of the genetically determined \$\backslash beta\$ may lead to an incredible lexical explosion. Our approximate scheme offers an explanation for the biological affinity of different species and their simultaneous linguistic disparity.},

Learning theory formalizes the task of language acquisition it can be shown that no procedure can learn an unrestricted set of languages. Universal grammar specifies the restricted set of languages learnable by the human brain.

How universal grammar arose is a major challenge for evolutionary biology. We present a mathematical framework for the evolutionary dynamics of grammar learning. The central result is a coherence threshold, which specifies the condition for a universal grammar to induce coherent communication within a population. We study selection of grammars within the same universal grammar and competition between different universal grammars. We calculate the condition under which natural selection favors the emergence of rule-based, generative grammars that underlie complex language.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Electronic media use is becoming an increasingly important part of life for today's school-aged children. At the same time, concern of children's sleep habits has arisen, and cross-sectional studies have shown that electronic media use is associated with short sleep duration and sleep disturbances. The purpose of this longitudinal study was to investigate whether baseline electronic media use and media presence in a child's bedroom predicted sleep habits as well as changes in these sleep habits 18 months later among 10- to 11-year-old children in Finland.

METHODS: The school-aged children (n=353, 51\% girls) from 27 schools answered a questionnaire in 2006 and again 2008 in the Helsinki region of Finland. Electronic media use was measured by computer use and TV viewing. Media presence in a child's bedroom means the presence of a TV or a computer in a child's bedroom. Sleep habits were measured by bedtimes on school days and at the weekend days, sleep duration, discrepancy of bedtimes, and discrepancy of sleep duration between school days and weekends. Linear regression analyses were used to examine whether electronic media use and media presence predicted sleep habits with adjustments for grade, family structure, and baseline sleep. Gender differences were also examined.

RESULTS: The children used a computer for one hour per day and watched TV over one hour a day in 2006. They slept over nine hours on school days and over ten hours at the weekends in 2008. Computer use and television viewing predicted significantly shorter sleep duration (p<0.001, p<0.05 respectively) and later bedtimes (p<0.001, p<0.01, respectively). Computer use also predicted unfavourable changes in sleep duration (p<0.001) and bedtimes on school days (p<0.001) and weekends (p<0.01). Among boys, media presence in the bedroom predicted poorer sleep habits and irregularity of sleep habits.

CONCLUSIONS: Computer use, TV viewing, and the presence of media in children's bedrooms may reduce sleep duration, and delay bedtimes.},

  Abstract                 = {Cellulose samples treated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and carbon dioxide in dimethylacetamide (DMAc) were analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy. Absorbance of hydrogen-bonded OH stretching was considerably decreased by the treatment of NaOH and carbon dioxide. The relative absorbance ratio (A(4000-2995)/A(993)) represented the decrease of absorbance as a criterion of hydrogen-bond intensity (HBI). The absorbance of the band at 1430cm(-1) due to a crystalline absorption was also decreased by NaOH treatment. The absorbance ratio of the bands at 1430 and 987-893cm(-1) (A(1430)/A(900)), adopted as crystallinity index (CI), was closely related to the portion of cellulose I structure. With the help of FTIR equipped with an on-line evacuation apparatus, broad OH bending due to bound water could be eliminated. FTIR spectra of the carbon dioxide-treated cellulose samples at 1700-1525cm(-1) were divided into some bands including 1663, 1635, 1616, and 1593cm(-1). The broad OH bending due to bound water at 1641-1645cm(-1) was resolved to two bands at 1663 and 1635cm(-1). As a trace of DMAc, the band at 1616cm(-1) is disappeared by washing for the cellulose treated with carbon dioxide (Cell 1-C and Cell 2/60-C). The decrease of HBI, the easy removal of DMAc, and the band at 1593cm(-1) supported the introduction of new chemical structure in cellulose. The bands shown at 1593 and 1470cm(-1) was assigned as hydrogen-bonded carbonyl stretching and O-C-O stretching of the carbonate ion.},

An annotation jamboree was held in Japan with the aim of annotating and manually curating all the genes in the rice genome. Here we present the Rice Annotation Project Database (RAP-DB), which has been developed to provide access to the annotation data. The RAP-DB has two different types of annotation viewers, BLAST and BLAT search, and other useful features. By connecting the annotations to other rice genomics data, such as full-length cDNAs and Tos17 mutant lines, the RAP-DB serves as a hub for rice genomics. All of the resources can be accessed through http://rapdb.lab.nig.ac.jp/.},

In both endosymbioses, there are distinct phases to the interaction, including a presymbiotic anticipation phase and, subsequently, an intraradical accommodation of the microsymbiont. Maintenance of the endosymbiosis then depends on reciprocal nutrient exchange with the microsymbiont-obtaining plant photosynthates in exchange for mineral nutrients: enhanced phosphate and nitrogen uptake from AM fungi and fixed nitrogen from rhizobia. Despite the taxonomically distinct groups of symbionts, commonalities are observed in the signaling components and the modulation of host cell responses in both AM and RN symbioses, reflecting common mechanisms for plant cell reprogramming during endosymbiosis.},

To better understand the nature of repetitive sequences in plants and provide a resource for identifying such sequences, we constructed databases of repetitive sequences for 12 plant genera: Arabidopsis, Brassica, Glycine, Hordeum, Lotus, Lycopersicon, Medicago, Oryza, Solanum, Sorghum, Triticum and Zea (www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/plant. repeats/index.shtml). The repetitive sequences within each database have been coded into super-classes, classes and sub-classes based on sequence and structure similarity. These databases are available for sequence similarity searches as well as downloadable files either as entire databases or subsets of each database. To further the utility for comparative studies and to provide a resource for searching for repetitive sequences in other genera within these families, repetitive sequences have been combined into four databases to represent the Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Gramineae and Solanaceae families. Collectively, these databases provide a resource for the identification, classification and analysis of repetitive sequences in plants.},

  Abstract                 = {Horizontal transfer (HT) is central to the evolution of prokaryotic species. Selfish and mobile genetic elements, such as phages, plasmids, and transposons, are the primary vehicles for HT among prokaryotes. In multicellular eukaryotes, the prevalence and evolutionary significance of HT remain unclear. Here, we identified a set of DNA transposon families dubbed SPACE INVADERS (or SPIN) whose consensus sequences are \^{a}Â‰Âˆ96\% identical over their entire length (2.9 kb) in the genomes of murine rodents (rat/mouse), bushbaby (prosimian primate), little brown bat (laurasiatherian), tenrec (afrotherian), opossum (marsupial), and two non-mammalian tetrapods (anole lizard and African clawed frog). In contrast, SPIN elements were undetectable in other species represented in the sequence databases, including 19 other mammals with draft whole-genome assemblies. This patchy distribution, coupled with the extreme level of SPIN identity in widely divergent tetrapods and the overall lack of selective constraint acting on these elements, is incompatible with vertical inheritance, but strongly indicative of multiple horizontal introductions. We show that these germline infiltrations likely occurred around the same evolutionary time (15\^{a}Â€Â“46 mya) and spawned some of the largest bursts of DNA transposon activity ever recorded in any species lineage (nearly 100,000 SPIN copies per haploid genome in tenrec). The process also led to the emergence of a new gene in the murine lineage derived from a SPIN transposase. In summary, HT of DNA transposons has contributed significantly to shaping and diversifying the genomes of multiple mammalian and tetrapod species.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: The size of current protein databases is a challenge for many Bioinformatics applications, both in terms of processing speed and information redundancy. It may be therefore desirable to efficiently reduce the database of interest to a maximally representative subset. Results: The MinSet method employs a combination of a Suffix Tree and a Genetic Algorithm for the generation, selection and assessment of database subsets. The approach is generally applicable to any type of string-encoded data, allowing for a drastic reduction of the database size whilst retaining most of the information contained in the original set. We demonstrate the performance of the method on a database of protein domain structures encoded as strings. We used the SCOP40 domain database by translating protein structures into character strings by means of a structural alphabet and by extracting optimized subsets according to an entropy score that is based on a constant-length fragment dictionary. Therefore, optimized subsets are maximally representative for the distribution and range of local structures. Subsets containing only 10\% of the SCOP structure classes show a coverage of >90\% for fragments of length 1-4.

  Abstract                 = {Streams of user-generated content in social media exhibit patterns of collective attention across diverse topics, with temporal structures determined both by exogenous factors and endogenous factors. Teasing apart different topics and resolving their individual, concurrent, activity timelines is a key challenge in extracting knowledge from microblog streams. Facing this challenge requires the use of methods that expose latent signals by using term correlations across posts and over time. Here we focus on content posted to Twitter during the London 2012 Olympics, for which a detailed schedule of events is independently available and can be used for reference. We mine the temporal structure of topical activity by using two methods based on non-negative matrix factorization. We show that for events in the Olympics schedule that can be semantically matched to Twitter topics, the extracted Twitter activity timeline closely matches the known timeline from the schedule. Our results show that, given appropriate techniques to detect latent signals, Twitter can be used as a social sensor to extract topical-temporal information on real-world events at high temporal resolution.},

To this end, a binary representation of written texts and the generated symbolic sequences are examined by the standard block entropy analysis and the Shannon and Kolmogorov entropies are obtained. It is found that both entropies are sensitive to both language and text category with the text category sensitivity to follow almost the same trends in both languages (English and Greek) considered. The values of these entropies are compared with those of stochastically generated symbolic sequences and the nature of correlations present in this representation of real written texts is identified.},

  Abstract                 = {Integration of structural genomic data from a largely assembled rice genome sequence, with phylogenetic analysis of sequence samples for many other taxa, suggests that a polyploidization event occurred \^{a}â€°Ë†70 million years ago, before the divergence of the major cereals from one another but after the divergence of the Poales from the Liliales and Zingiberales. Ancient polyploidization and subsequent \^{a}â‚¬\oe diploidization\^{a}â‚¬ (loss) of many duplicated gene copies has thus shaped the genomes of all Poaceae cereal, forage, and biomass crops. The Poaceae appear to have evolved as separate lineages for \^{a}â€°Ë†50 million years, or two-thirds of the time since the duplication event. Chromosomes that are predicted to be homoeologs resulting from this ancient duplication event account for a disproportionate share of incongruent loci found by comparison of the rice sequence to a detailed sorghum sequence-tagged site-based genetic map. Differential gene loss during diploidization may have contributed many of these incongruities. Such predicted homoeologs also account for a disproportionate share of duplicated sorghum loci, further supporting the hypothesis that the polyploidization event was common to sorghum and rice. Comparative gene orders along paleo-homoeologous chromosomal segments provide a means to make phylogenetic inferences about chromosome structural rearrangements that differentiate among the grasses. Superimposition of the timing of major duplication events on taxonomic relationships leads to improved understanding of comparative gene orders, enhancing the value of data from botanical models for crop improvement and for further exploration of genomic biodiversity. Additional ancient duplication events probably remain to be discovered in other angiosperm lineages.},

  Abstract                 = {By aggregating self-reported health statuses across millions of users, we seek to characterize the variety of health information discussed in Twitter. We describe a topic modeling framework for discovering health topics in Twitter, a social media website. This is an exploratory approach with the goal of understanding what health topics are commonly discussed in social media. This paper describes in detail a statistical topic model created for this purpose, the Ailment Topic Aspect Model (ATAM), as well as our system for filtering general Twitter data based on health keywords and supervised classification. We show how ATAM and other topic models can automatically infer health topics in 144 million Twitter messages from 2011 to 2013. ATAM discovered 13 coherent clusters of Twitter messages, some of which correlate with seasonal influenza (r = 0.689) and allergies (r = 0.810) temporal surveillance data, as well as exercise (r = â€Š.534) and obesity (r = â€Š-.631) related geographic survey data in the United States. These results demonstrate that it is possible to automatically discover topics that attain statistically significant correlations with ground truth data, despite using minimal human supervision and no historical data to train the model, in contrast to prior work. Additionally, these results demonstrate that a single general-purpose model can identify many different health topics in social media.},

In particular, we treat the parallel composition operator on PAs, the semantics of a PA as a set of trace distributions, an extension of the PA model with time and simulation relations for PAs. Finally, we give an overview of various other state based models that are used for the analysis of probabilistic systems.},

  Abstract                 = {It is tempting to treat frequency trends from Google Books data sets as indicators for the true popularity of various words and phrases. Doing so allows us to draw novel conclusions about the evolution of public perception of a given topic, such as time and gender. However, sampling published works by availability and ease of digitization leads to several important effects. One of these is the surprising ability of a single prolific author to noticeably insert new phrases into a language. A greater effect arises from scientific texts, which have become increasingly prolific in the last several decades and are heavily sampled in the corpus. The result is a surge of phrases typical to academic articles but less common in general, such as references to time in the form of citations. Here, we highlight these dynamics by examining and comparing major contributions to the statistical divergence of English data sets between decades in the period 1800--2000. We find that only the English Fiction data set from the second version of the corpus is not heavily affected by professional texts, in clear contrast to the first version of the fiction data set and both unfiltered English data sets. Our findings emphasize the need to fully characterize the dynamics of the Google Books corpus before using these data sets to draw broad conclusions about cultural and linguistic evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Amino acid sequence alignments are widely used in the analysis of protein structure, function and evolutionary relationships. Proteins within a superfamily usually share the same fold and possess related functions. These structural and functional constraints are reflected in the alignment conservation patterns. Positions of functional and/or structural importance tend to be more conserved. Conserved positions are usually clustered in distinct motifs surrounded by sequence segments of low conservation. Poorly conserved regions might also arise from the imperfections in multiple alignment algorithms and thus indicate possible alignment errors. Quantification of conservation by attributing a conservation index to each aligned position makes motif detection more convenient. Mapping these conservation indices onto a protein spatial structure helps to visualize spatial conservation features of the molecule and to predict functionally and/or structurally important sites. Analysis of conservation indices could be a useful tool in detection of potentially misaligned regions and will aid in improvement of multiple alignments. Results: We developed a program to calculate a conservation index at each position in a multiple sequence alignment using several methods. Namely, amino acid frequencies at each position are estimated and the conservation index is calculated from these frequencies. We utilize both unweighted frequencies and frequencies weighted using two different strategies. Three conceptually different approaches (entropy-based, variance-based and matrix score-based) are implemented in the algorithm to define the conservation index. Calculating conservation indices for 35522 positions in 284 alignments from SMART database we demonstrate that different methods result in highly correlated (correlation coefficient more than 0.85) conservation indices. Conservation indices show statistically significant correlation between sequentially adjacent positions [IMG]f1.gif" BORDER="0">and [IMG]f2.gif" BORDER="0">, where [IMG]f3.gif" BORDER="0">, and averaging of the indices over the window of three positions is optimal for motif detection. Positions with gaps display substantially lower conservation properties. We compare conservation properties of the SMART alignments or FSSP structural alignments to those of the ClustalW alignments. The results suggest that conservation indices should be a valuable tool of alignment quality assessment and might be used as an objective function for refinement of multiple alignments.

  Abstract                 = {Writing about important personal experiences in an emotional way for as little as 15 minutes over the course of three days brings about improvements in mental and physical health. This finding has been replicated across age, gender, culture, social class, and personality type. Using a text-analysis computer program, it was discovered that those who benefit maximally from writing tend to use a high number of positive-emotion words, a moderate amount of negative-emotion words, and increase their use of cognitive words over the days of writing. These findings suggest that the formation of a narrative is critical and is an indicator of good mental and physical health. Ongoing studies suggest that writing serves the function of organizing complex emotional experiences. Implications for these findings for psychotherapy are briefly discussed.},

We find that the most common words and phrases in any given year had a much shorter popularity lifespan in the sixteenth century than they had in the twentieth century. By measuring how their usage propagated across the years, we show that for the past two centuries, the process has been governed by linear preferential attachment. Along with the steady growth of the English lexicon, this provides an empirical explanation for the ubiquity of Zipf's law in language statistics and confirms that writing, although undoubtedly an expression of art and skill, is not immune to the same influences of self-organization that are known to regulate processes as diverse as the making of new friends and World Wide Web growth.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Genome evolution and size variation in multicellular organisms are profoundly influenced by the activity of retrotransposons. In higher eukaryotes with compact genomes retrotransposons are found in lower copy numbers than in larger genomes, which could be due to either suppression of transposition or to elimination of insertions, and are non-randomly distributed along the chromosomes. The evolutionary mechanisms constraining retrotransposon copy number and chromosomal distribution are still poorly understood.RESULTS:I investigated the evolutionary dynamics of long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons in the compact Arabidopsis thaliana genome, using an automated method for obtaining genome-wide, age and physical distribution profiles for different groups of elements, and then comparing the distributions of young and old insertions. Elements of the Pseudoviridae family insert randomly along the chromosomes and have been recently active, but insertions tend to be lost from euchromatic regions where they are less likely to fix, with a half-life estimated at approximately 470,000 years. In contrast, members of the Metaviridae (particularly Athila) preferentially target heterochromatin, and were more active in the past.CONCLUSION:Diverse evolutionary mechanisms have constrained both the copy number and chromosomal distribution of retrotransposons within a single genome. In A. thaliana, their non-random genomic distribution is due to both selection against insertions in euchromatin and preferential targeting of heterochromatin. Constant turnover of euchromatic insertions and a decline in activity for the elements that target heterochromatin have both limited the contribution of retrotransposon DNA to genome size expansion in A. thaliana.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Graph theory has been recently introduced to characterize complex brain networks, making it highly suitable to investigate altered connectivity in neurologic disorders. A current model proposes autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as a developmental disconnection syndrome, supported by converging evidence in both non-syndromic and syndromic ASD. However, the effects of abnormal connectivity on network properties have not been well studied, particularly in syndromic ASD. To close this gap, brain functional networks of electroencephalographic (EEG) connectivity were studied through graph measures in patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), a disorder with a high prevalence of ASD, as well as in patients with non-syndromic ASD.

METHODS: EEG data were collected from TSC patients with ASD (n = 14) and without ASD (n = 29), from patients with non-syndromic ASD (n = 16), and from controls (n = 46). First, EEG connectivity was characterized by the mean coherence, the ratio of inter- over intra-hemispheric coherence and the ratio of long- over short-range coherence. Next, graph measures of the functional networks were computed and a resilience analysis was conducted. To distinguish effects related to ASD from those related to TSC, a two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was applied, using age as a covariate.

RESULTS: Analysis of network properties revealed differences specific to TSC and ASD, and these differences were very consistent across subgroups. In TSC, both with and without a concurrent diagnosis of ASD, mean coherence, global efficiency, and clustering coefficient were decreased and the average path length was increased. These findings indicate an altered network topology. In ASD, both with and without a concurrent diagnosis of TSC, decreased long- over short-range coherence and markedly increased network resilience were found.

CONCLUSIONS: The altered network topology in TSC represents a functional correlate of structural abnormalities and may play a role in the pathogenesis of neurological deficits. The increased resilience in ASD may reflect an excessively degenerate network with local overconnection and decreased functional specialization. This joint study of TSC and ASD networks provides a unique window to common neurobiological mechanisms in autism.},

We report language independent patterns useful as benchmarks for theoretical models of language evolution. A significantly decreasing (increasing) trend in the birth (death) rate of words indicates a recent shift in the selection laws governing word use. For new words, we observe a peak in the growth-rate fluctuations around 40 years after introduction, consistent with the typical entry time into standard dictionaries and the human generational timescale. Pronounced changes in the dynamics of language during periods of war shows that word correlations, occurring across time and between words, are largely influenced by coevolutionary social, technological, and political factors. We quantify cultural memory by analyzing the long-term correlations in the use of individual words using detrended fluctuation analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {Cot-based sequence discovery represents a powerful means by which both low-copy and repetitive sequences can be selectively and efficiently fractionated, cloned, and characterized. Based upon the results of a Cot analysis, hydroxyapatite chromatography was used to fractionate sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) genomic DNA into highly repetitive (HR), moderately repetitive (MR), and single/low-copy (SL) sequence components that were consequently cloned to produce HRCot, MRCot, and SLCot genomic libraries. Filter hybridization (blotting) and sequence analysis both show that the HRCot library is enriched in sequences traditionally found in high-copy number (e.g., retroelements, rDNA, centromeric repeats), the SLCot library is enriched in low-copy sequences (e.g., genes and "nonrepetitive ESTs"), and the MRCot library contains sequences of moderate redundancy. The Cot analysis suggests that the sorghum genome is approximately 700 Mb (in agreement with previous estimates) and that HR, MR, and SL components comprise 15\%, 41\%, and 24\% of sorghum DNA, respectively. Unlike previously described techniques to sequence the low-copy components of genomes, sequencing of Cot components is independent of expression and methylation patterns that vary widely among DNA elements, developmental stages, and taxa. High-throughput sequencing of Cot clones may be a means of "capturing" the sequence complexity of eukaryotic genomes at unprecedented efficiency.[Online supplementary material is available at www.genome.org.

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The study of metabolism has attracted much attention during the last years due to its relevance in various diseases. The advance in metabolomics platforms allows us to detect an increasing number of metabolites in abnormal high/low concentration in a disease phenotype. Finding a mechanistic interpretation for these alterations is important to understand pathophysiological processes, however it is not an easy task. The availability of genome scale metabolic networks and Systems Biology techniques open new avenues to address this question.

RESULTS: In this article we present a novel mathematical framework to find enzymes whose malfunction explains the accumulation/depletion of a given metabolite in a disease phenotype. Our approach is based on a recently introduced pathway concept termed Carbon Flux Paths (CFPs), which extends classical topological definition by including network stoichiometry. Using CFPs, we determine the Connectivity Curve of an altered metabolite, which allows us to quantify changes in its pathway structure when a certain enzyme is removed. The influence of enzyme removal is then ranked and used to explain the accumulation/depletion of such metabolite. For illustration, we center our study in the accumulation of two metabolites (L-Cystine and Homocysteine) found in high concentration in the brain of patients with mental disorders. Our results were discussed based on literature and found a good agreement with previously reported mechanisms. In addition, we hypothesize a novel role of several enzymes for the accumulation of these metabolites, which opens new strategies to understand the metabolic processes underlying these diseases.

CONCLUSIONS: With personalized medicine on the horizon, metabolomic platforms are providing us with a vast amount of experimental data for a number of complex diseases. Our approach provides a novel apparatus to rationally investigate and understand metabolite alterations under disease phenotypes. This work contributes to the development of Systems Medicine, whose objective is to answer clinical questions based on theoretical methods and high-throughput "omics" data.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Whole genome amplification is an increasingly common technique through which minute amounts of DNA can be multiplied to generate quantities suitable for genetic testing and analysis. Questions of amplification-induced error and template bias generated by these methods have previously been addressed through either small scale (SNPs) or large scale (CGH array, FISH) methodologies. Here we utilized whole genome sequencing to assess amplification-induced bias in both coding and non-coding regions of two bacterial genomes. Halobacterium species NRC-1 DNA and Campylobacter jejuni were amplified by several common, commercially available protocols: multiple displacement amplification, primer extension pre-amplification and degenerate oligonucleotide primed PCR. The amplification-induced bias of each method was assessed by sequencing both genomes in their entirety using the 454 Sequencing System technology and comparing the results with those obtained from unamplified controls.RESULTS:All amplification methodologies induced statistically significant bias relative to the unamplified control. For the Halobacterium species NRC-1 genome, assessed at 100 base resolution, the D-statistics from GenomiPhi-amplified material were 119 times greater than those from unamplified material, 164.0 times greater for Repli-G, 165.0 times greater for PEP-PCR and 252.0 times greater than the unamplified controls for DOP-PCR. For Campylobacter jejuni, also analyzed at 100 base resolution, the D-statistics from GenomiPhi-amplified material were 15 times greater than those from unamplified material, 19.8 times greater for Repli-G, 61.8 times greater for PEP-PCR and 220.5 times greater than the unamplified controls for DOP-PCR.CONCLUSION:Of the amplification methodologies examined in this paper, the multiple displacement amplification products generated the least bias, and produced significantly higher yields of amplified DNA.},

In Abrams and Strogatz [Modeling the dynamics of language death, Nature 424 (2003) 900], the extinction of one of the competing languages is predicted, although in some case the coexistence occurs. The preservation of both languages was explained by Patriarca and Leppanen [Modeling language competition, Physica A 338 (2004) 296] by introducing the existence of two disjoint zones where each language is predominant. However, their results cannot explain the survivance of both languages in only one zone of competition. In this work we discuss their results and propose a new alternative model of Lotkaâ€“Volterra type in order to explain the coexistence of two languages.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability to analyze and classify three-dimensional (3D) biological morphology has lagged behind the analysis of other biological data types such as gene sequences. Here, we introduce the techniques of data mining to the study of 3D biological shapes to bring the analyses of phenomes closer to the efficiency of studying genomes. We compiled five training sets of highly variable morphologies of mammalian teeth from the MorphoBrowser database. Samples were labeled either by dietary class or by conventional dental types (e.g. carnassial, selenodont). We automatically extracted a multitude of topological attributes using Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-like procedures that were then used in several combinations of feature selection schemes and probabilistic classification models to build and optimize classifiers for predicting the labels of the training sets. In terms of classification accuracy, computational time and size of the feature sets used, non-repeated best-first search combined with 1-nearest neighbor classifier was the best approach. However, several other classification models combined with the same searching scheme proved practical. The current study represents a first step in the automatic analysis of 3D phenotypes, which will be increasingly valuable with the future increase in 3D morphology and phenomics databases.},

Owing to fact that the content of each post has been annotated with its emotional value, apart from the strictly structural properties, the study also includes an analysis of the average emotional response of the posts commenting the main story. While analysing correlations at the story level, an interesting relationship between the number of diggs and the number of comments received by a story was found. The correlation between the two quantities is high for data where small threads dominate and consistently decreases for longer threads. However, while the correlation of the number of diggs and the average emotional response tends to grow for longer threads, correlations between numbers of comments and the average emotional response are almost zero. We also show that the initial set of comments given to a story has a substantial impact on the further "life" of the discussion: high negative average emotions in the first 10 comments lead to longer threads while the opposite situation results in shorter discussions. We also suggest presence of two different mechanisms governing the evolution of the discussion and, consequently, its length.},

The recent sequencing of the chimpanzee genome is providing an unprecedented opportunity to study the functional significance of these elements in two closely related primate species and to better evaluate their role in primate evolution.RESULTS:We report here that the chimpanzee genome contains at least 42 separate families of endogenous retroviruses, nine of which were not previously identified. All but two (CERV 1/PTERV1 and CERV 2) of the 42 families of chimpanzee endogenous retroviruses were found to have orthologs in humans. Molecular analysis (PCR and Southern hybridization) of CERV 2 elements demonstrates that this family is present in chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla and old-world monkeys but absent in human, orangutan and new-world monkeys. A survey of endogenous retroviral positional variation between chimpanzees and humans determined that approximately 7\% of all chimpanzee-human INDEL variation is associated with endogenous retroviral sequences.CONCLUSION:Nine families of chimpanzee endogenous retroviruses have been transpositionally active since chimpanzees and humans diverged from a common ancestor. Seven of these transpositionally active families have orthologs in humans, one of which has also been transpositionally active in humans since the human-chimpanzee divergence about six million years ago. Comparative analyses of orthologous regions of the human and chimpanzee genomes have revealed that a significant portion of INDEL variation between chimpanzees and humans is attributable to endogenous retroviruses and may be of evolutionary significance.},

  Abstract                 = {Historical linguistics aims at inferring the most likely language phylogenetic tree starting from information concerning the evolutionary relatedness of languages. The available information are typically lists of homologous (lexical, phonological, syntactic) features or characters for many different languages. From this perspective the reconstruction of language trees is an example of inverse problems: starting from present, incomplete and often noisy, information, one aims at inferring the most likely past evolutionary history. A fundamental issue in inverse problems is the evaluation of the inference made. A standard way of dealing with this question is to generate data with artificial models in order to have full access to the evolutionary process one is going to infer. This procedure presents an intrinsic limitation: when dealing with real data sets, one typically does not know which model of evolution is the most suitable for them. A possible way out is to compare algorithmic inference with expert classifications. This is the point of view we take here by conducting a thorough survey of the accuracy of reconstruction methods as compared with the Ethnologue expert classifications. We focus in particular on state-of-the-art distance-based methods for phylogeny reconstruction using worldwide linguistic databases. In order to assess the accuracy of the inferred trees we introduce and characterize two generalizations of standard definitions of distances between trees. Based on these scores we quantify the relative performances of the distance-based algorithms considered. Further we quantify how the completeness and the coverage of the available databases affect the accuracy of the reconstruction. Finally we draw some conclusions about where the accuracy of the reconstructions in historical linguistics stands and about the leading directions to improve it.},

  Abstract                 = {The Ensembl pipeline is an extension to the Ensembl system which allows automated annotation of genomic sequence. The software comprises two parts. First, there is a set of Perl modules ("Runnables" and "RunnableDBs") which are `wrappers' for a variety of commonly used analysis tools. These retrieve sequence data from a relational database, run the analysis, and write the results back to the database. They inherit from a common interface, which simplifies the writing of new wrapper modules. On top of this sits a job submission system (the "RuleManager") which allows efficient and reliable submission of large numbers of jobs to a compute farm. Here we describe the fundamental software components of the pipeline, and we also highlight some features of the Sanger installation which were necessary to enable the pipeline to scale to whole-genome analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {We previously identified a group of atypical mobile elements designated Mavericks from the nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae and the zebrafish Danio rerio. Here we present the results of comprehensive database searches of the genome sequences available, which reveal that Mavericks are widespread in invertebrates and non-mammalian vertebrates but show a patchy distribution in non-animal species, being present in the fungi Glomus intraradices and Phakopsora pachyrhizi and in several single-celled eukaryotes such as the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, the stramenopile Phytophthora infestans and the trichomonad Trichomonas vaginalis, but not detectable in plants. This distribution, together with comparative and phylogenetic analyses of Maverick-encoded proteins, is suggestive of an ancient origin of these elements in eukaryotes followed by lineage-specific losses and/or recurrent episodes of horizontal transmission. In addition, we report that Maverick elements have amplified recently to high copy numbers in T. vaginalis where they now occupy as much as 30\% of the genome. Sequence analysis confirms that most Mavericks encode a retroviral-like integrase, but lack other open reading frames typically found in retroelements. Nevertheless, the length and conservation of the target site duplication created upon Maverick insertion (5- or 6-bp) is consistent with a role of the integrase-like protein in the integration of a double-stranded DNA transposition intermediate. Mavericks also display long terminal-inverted repeats but do not contain ORFs similar to proteins encoded by DNA transposons. Instead, Mavericks encode a conserved set of 5 to 9 genes (in addition to the integrase) that are predicted to encode proteins with homology to replication and packaging proteins of some bacteriophages and diverse eukaryotic double-stranded DNA viruses, including a DNA polymerase B homolog and putative capsid proteins. Based on these and other structural similarities, we speculate that Mavericks represent an evolutionary missing link between seemingly disparate invasive DNA elements that include bacteriophages, adenoviruses and eukaryotic linear plasmids.},

The Naming Game is a simple model capable of accounting for the emergence of a lexicon, intended as the set of words through which objects are named. We introduce a stochastic modification of the Naming Game model with the aim of characterizing the emergence of a new language as the result of the interaction of agents. We fix the initial phase by splitting the population in two sets speaking either language A or B. Whenever the result of the interaction of two individuals results in an agent able to speak both A and B, we introduce a finite probability that this state turns into a new idiom C, so to mimic a sort of hybridization process. We study the system in the space of parameters defining the interaction, and show that the proposed model displays a rich variety of behaviours, despite the simple mean field topology of interactions.},

A fundamental question is whether categories simply mirror an underlying structure of nature or instead come from the complex interactions of human beings among themselves and with the environment. Here, we address this question by modeling a population of individuals who co-evolve their own system of symbols and meanings by playing elementary language games. The central result is the emergence of a hierarchical category structure made of two distinct levels: a basic layer, responsible for fine discrimination of the environment, and a shared linguistic layer that groups together perceptions to guarantee communicative success. Remarkably, the number of linguistic categories turns out to be finite and small, as observed in natural languages.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Protein complexes integrate multiple gene products to coordinate many biological functions. Given a graph representing pairwise protein interaction data one can search for subgraphs representing protein complexes. Previous methods for performing such search relied on the assumption that complexes form a clique in that graph. While this assumption is true for some complexes, it does not hold for many others. New algorithms are required in order to recover complexes with other types of topological structure. Results: We present an algorithm for inferring protein complexes from weighted interaction graphs. By using graph topological patterns and biological properties as features, we model each complex subgraph by a probabilistic Bayesian network (BN). We use a training set of known complexes to learn the parameters of this BN model. The log-likelihood ratio derived from the BN is then used to score subgraphs in the protein interaction graph and identify new complexes. We applied our method to protein interaction data in yeast. As we show our algorithm achieved a considerable improvement over clique based algorithms in terms of its ability to recover known complexes. We discuss some of the new complexes predicted by our algorithm and determine that they likely represent true complexes.

We herein established the BOD (Bioinformatics on demand) system to use Grid computing technology to set up a virtual workbench via a web-based platform, to assist researchers performing customized comprehensive bioinformatics work. Users will be able to submit entire search queries and computation requests, e.g. from DNA assembly to gene prediction and finally protein folding, from their own office using the BOD end-user web interface. The BOD web portal parses the user's job requests into steps, each of which may contain multiple tasks in parallel. The BOD task scheduler takes an entire task, or splits it into multiple subtasks, and dispatches the task or subtasks proportionally to computation node(s) associated with the BOD portal server. A node may further split and distribute an assigned task to its sub-nodes using a similar strategy. In the end, the BOD portal server receives and collates all results and returns them to the user. BOD uses a pipeline model to describe the user's submitted data and stores the job requests/status/results in a relational database. In addition, an XML criterion is established to capture task computation program details.},

We propose a "comparative thermo-linguistic" technique to analyze the vocabulary of a text to determine its academic level and its target readership in any given language. We apply this technique to a large number of books by several authors and examine how the vocabulary of a text changes when it is translated from one language to another. Unlike the uniform results produced using the Zipf law, using our "word energy" distribution technique we find variations in the power-law behavior. We also examine some common features that span across languages and identify some intriguing questions concerning how to determine when a text is suitable for its intended readership.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are abundant across genomes. However, the significance of SSRs in organellar genomes of rice has not been completely understood. The availability of organellar genome sequences allows us to understand the organization of SSRs in their genic and intergenic regions. Results: We have analyzed SSRs in mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes of rice. We identified 2528 SSRs in the mitochondrial genome and average 870 SSRs in the chloroplast genomes. About 8.7\% of the mitochondrial and 27.5\% of the chloroplast SSRs were observed in the genic region. Dinucleotides were the most abundant repeats in genic and intergenic regions of the mitochondrial genome while mononucleotides were predominant in the chloroplast genomes. The rps and nad gene clusters of mitochondria had the maximum repeats, while the rpo and ndh gene clusters of chloroplast had the maximum repeats. We identified SSRs in both organellar genomes and validated in different cultivars and species. Contact: rms\_28@rediffmail.com.

  Abstract                 = {DNA transposons, or class 2 transposable elements, have successfully propagated in a wide variety of genomes. However, it is widely believed that DNA transposon activity has ceased in mammalian genomes for at least the last 40 million years. We recently reported evidence for the relatively recent activity of and elements, two distinct groups of DNA transposons, in the lineage of the vespertilionid bat . Here, we describe seven additional families that have also been recently active in the bat lineage. Early vespertilionid genome evolution was dominated by the activity of s, -like and -like elements. This was followed by the colonization of -like elements, and by a more recent explosion of -like elements. Finally, and most recently, -like elements have amplified within the genome and our results indicate that one of these families is probably still expanding in natural populations. Together, these data suggest that there has been tremendous recent activity of various DNA transposons in the bat lineage that far exceeds those previously reported for any mammalian lineage. The diverse and recent populations of DNA transposons in genus will provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the impact of this class of elements on mammalian genome evolution and to better understand what makes some species more susceptible to invasion by genomic parasites than others.},

In this report, we provide the first detailed characterization of an interspersed repeat element in any crocodilian genome. Chompy is a putative miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) family initially recovered from the genome of Alligator mississippiensis (American alligator) but also present in the genomes of Crocodylus moreletii (Morelet's crocodile) and Gavialis gangeticus (Indian gharial). The element has all of the hallmarks of MITEs including terminal inverted repeats, possible target site duplications, and a tendency to form secondary structures. We estimate the copy number in the alligator genome to be \~{}46,000 copies. As a result of their size and unique properties, Chompy elements may provide a useful source of genomic variation for crocodilian comparative genomics.},

While both classes of transposable elements, the DNA transposons and the retrotransposons, show substantial expansion in plants and invertebrates, the DNA transposons are thought to have become inactive in mammalian genomes long ago. Here, we report the first evidence for recent activity of DNA transposons in a mammalian lineage, the bat genus Myotis. Six recently active families of non-autonomous hAT transposons were identified in the M. lucifugus genome using computational tools. Low sequence divergence among the individual sequences and between individual sequences and their respective consensus sequences suggest their recent expansion in the M. lucifugus genome. Furthermore, amplification and sequencing of polymorphic insertion loci in a related taxon, M. austroriparius, confirms their recent activity. Myotis is one of the largest mammalian genera with 103 species. The discovery of DNA transposon activity in this genus may therefore influence our understanding of genome evolution and diversification in bats and in mammals in general. Furthermore, the identification of a likely autonomous element may lead to new approaches for mammalian genetic manipulation.},

We show that the most basic form of cross-situational learning - whereby information from multiple episodes is combined to eliminate incorrect meanings - can perform badly when words are learned independently and meanings are drawn from a nonuniform distribution. If learners further assume that no two words share a common meaning, we find a phase transition between a maximally-efficient learning regime, where the learning time is reduced to the shortest it can possibly be, and a partially-efficient regime where incorrect candidate meanings for words persist at late times. We obtain exact results for the word-learning process through an equivalence to a statistical mechanical problem of enumerating loops in the space of word-meaning mappings.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania are causative agents of a diverse spectrum of human diseases collectively known as leishmaniasis. These eukaryotic pathogens that diverged early from the main eukaryotic lineage possess a number of unusual genomic, molecular and biochemical features. The completion of the genome projects for three Leishmania species has generated invaluable information enabling a direct analysis of genome structure and organization.RESULTS:By using DNA macroarrays, made with Leishmania infantum genomic clones and hybridized with total DNA from the parasite, we identified a clone containing a repeated sequence. An analysis of the recently completed genome sequence of L. infantum, using this repeated sequence as bait, led to the identification of a new class of repeated elements that are interspersed along the different L. infantum chromosomes. These elements turned out to be homologues of SIDER2 sequences, which were recently identified in the Leishmania major genome; thus, we adopted this nomenclature for the Leishmania elements described herein. Since SIDER2 elements are very heterogeneous in sequence, their precise identification is rather laborious. We have characterized 54 LiSIDER2 elements in chromosome 32 and 27 ones in chromosome 20. The mean size for these elements is 550 bp and their sequence is G+C rich (mean value of 66.5\%). On the basis of sequence similarity, these elements can be grouped in subfamilies that show a remarkable relationship of proximity, i.e. SIDER2s of a given subfamily locate close in a chromosomal region without intercalating elements. For comparative purposes, we have identified the SIDER2 elements existing in L. major and Leishmania braziliensis chromosomes 32. While SIDER2 elements are highly conserved both in number and location between L. infantum and L. major, no such conservation exists when comparing with SIDER2s in L. braziliensis chromosome 32.CONCLUSION:SIDER2 elements constitute a relevant piece in the Leishmania genome organization. Sequence characteristics, genomic distribution and evolutionarily conservation of SIDER2s are suggestive of relevant functions for these elements in Leishmania. Apart from a proved involvement in post-trancriptional mechanisms of gene regulation, SIDER2 elements could be involved in DNA amplification processes and, perhaps, in chromosome segregation as centromeric sequences.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:LTR retrotransposons are a class of mobile genetic elements containing two similar long terminal repeats (LTRs). Currently, LTR retrotransposons are annotated in eukaryotic genomes mainly through the conventional homology searching approach. Hence, it is limited to annotating known elements.RESULTS:In this paper, we report a de novo computational method that can identify new LTR retrotransposons without relying on a library of known elements. Specifically, our method identifies intact LTR retrotransposons by using an approximate string matching technique and protein domain analysis. In addition, it identifies partially deleted or solo LTRs using profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs). As a result, this method can de novo identify all types of LTR retrotransposons. We tested this method on the two pairs of eukaryotic genomes, C. elegans vs. C. briggsae and D. melanogaster vs. D. pseudoobscura. LTR retrotransposons in C. elegans and D. melanogaster have been intensively studied using conventional annotation methods. Comparing with previous work, we identified new intact LTR retroelements and new putative families, which may imply that there may still be new retroelements that are left to be discovered even in well-studied organisms. To assess the sensitivity and accuracy of our method, we compared our results with a previously published method, LTR\_STRUC, which predominantly identifies full-length LTR retrotransposons. In summary, both methods identified comparable number of intact LTR retroelements. But our method can identify nearly all known elements in C. elegans, while LTR\_STRUCT missed about 1/3 of them. Our method also identified more known LTR retroelements than LTR\_STRUCT in the D. melanogaster genome. We also identified some LTR retroelements in the other two genomes, C. briggsae and D. pseudoobscura, which have not been completely finished. In contrast, the conventional method failed to identify those elements. Finally, the phylogenetic and chromosomal distributions of the identified elements are discussed.CONCLUSION:We report a novel method for de novo identification of LTR retrotransposons in eukaryotic genomes with favorable performance over the existing methods.},

To test the theory, they trained the model to associate names, verbal descriptions, and visual representations of objects. When its inputs and outputs are constructed to capture aspects of structure apparent in attribute-norming experiments, the model provides an intuitive account of semantic task performance. The authors then used the model to understand the structure of impaired performance in patients with selective and progressive impairments of conceptual knowledge. Data from 4 well-known semantic tasks revealed consistent patterns that find a ready explanation in the model. The relationship between the model and related theories of semantic representation is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The production and comprehension of human language is thought to involve a network of frontal, parietal, and temporal cortical loci interconnected by two dominant white matter pathways. These two white matter bundles, often referred to as the dorsal and ventral processing tracts, are hypothesized to have markedly different language functions. The dorsal tract is thought to process phonological processing, while the ventral tract is considered to abet semantics. This proposed functional differentiation of tracts is similar to the ventral and dorsal dichotomy proposed for the visual and auditory systems. The present study evaluated this characterization of the language system in the context of various components involved in its function. Twenty-four chronic stroke patients completed a battery of 10 language tests designed to measure performance on the comprehension and production of phonology, morphology, semantics, and syntax. The patients also completed diffusion MRI scanning. Lesions were confined to the left hemisphere, but the size and location of the insult varied so that patients had damage to a single tract, both tracts, or neither tract. Individual FA maps were generated, and focal areas of hypointensity served as markers of white matter damage. Whole-brain voxel-by-voxel correlations revealed that only phonological and semantic tasks fit into the dual-stream model, while syntax and morphology involved both pathways. ROI analyses of the arcuate fascicle and extreme capsule supported this finding. These data suggest that natural language function is more likely to reflect a synergistic system rather than a segregated dual-stream system.},

  Abstract                 = {SignificancePeople have long debated about the global influence of languages. The speculations that fuel this debate, however, rely on measures of language importance--such as income and population--that lack external validation as measures of a language's global influence. Here we introduce a metric of a language's global influence based on its position in the network connecting languages that are co-spoken. We show that the connectivity of a language in this network, after controlling for the number of speakers of a language and their income, remains a strong predictor of a language's influence when validated against two independent measures of the cultural content produced by a language's speakers. Languages vary enormously in global importance because of historical, demographic, political, and technological forces. However, beyond simple measures of population and economic power, there has been no rigorous quantitative way to define the global influence of languages. Here we use the structure of the networks connecting multilingual speakers and translated texts, as expressed in book translations, multiple language editions of Wikipedia, and Twitter, to provide a concept of language importance that goes beyond simple economic or demographic measures. We find that the structure of these three global language networks (GLNs) is centered on English as a global hub and around a handful of intermediate hub languages, which include Spanish, German, French, Russian, Portuguese, and Chinese. We validate the measure of a language's centrality in the three GLNs by showing that it exhibits a strong correlation with two independent measures of the number of famous people born in the countries associated with that language. These results suggest that the position of a language in the GLN contributes to the visibility of its speakers and the global popularity of the cultural content they produce.},

  Abstract                 = {Networks play a crucial role in computational biology, yet their analysis and representation is still an open problem. Power Graph Analysis is a lossless transformation of biological networks into a compact, less redundant representation, exploiting the abundance of cliques and bicliques as elementary topological motifs. We demonstrate with five examples the advantages of Power Graph Analysis. Investigating protein-protein interaction networks, we show how the catalytic subunits of the casein kinase II complex are distinguishable from the regulatory subunits, how interaction profiles and sequence phylogeny of SH3 domains correlate, and how false positive interactions among high-throughput interactions are spotted. Additionally, we demonstrate the generality of Power Graph Analysis by applying it to two other types of networks. We show how power graphs induce a clustering of both transcription factors and target genes in bipartite transcription networks, and how the erosion of a phosphatase domain in type 22 non-receptor tyrosine phosphatases is detected. We apply Power Graph Analysis to high-throughput protein interaction networks and show that up to 85\% (56\% on average) of the information is redundant. Experimental networks are more compressible than rewired ones of same degree distribution, indicating that experimental networks are rich in cliques and bicliques. Power Graphs are a novel representation of networks, which reduces network complexity by explicitly representing re-occurring network motifs. Power Graphs compress up to 85\% of the edges in protein interaction networks and are applicable to all types of networks such as protein interactions, regulatory networks, or homology networks.},

Since the downward closure property does not hold for such rules, we propose an optimization setting for finding locally optimal rules. A simple gradient descent algorithm optimizes a parameterized score function, where iterations optimizing the first separating hyperplane alternate with iterations optimizing the second. Experiments with two real-world data sets show that the approach finds non-random patterns and scales up well. We therefore propose quantitative association rules based on half-spaces as an interesting new class of patterns with a high potential for applications.},

  Abstract                 = {The public expressed sequence tag collections are continually being enriched with high-quality sequences that represent an ever-expanding range of taxonomically diverse plant species. While these sequence collections provide biased insight into the populations of expressed genes available within individual species and their associated tissues, the information is conceivably of wider relevance in a comparative context. When we consider the available expressed sequence tag (EST) collections of summer 2004, most of the major plant taxonomic clades are at least superficially represented. Investigation of the five million available plant ESTs provides a wealth of information that has applications in modelling the routes of plant genome evolution and the identification of lineage-specific genes and gene families. Over four million ESTs from over 50 distinct plant species have been collated within an EST analysis pipeline called openSputnik. The ESTs were resolved down into approximately one million unigene sequences. These have been annotated using orthology-based annotation transfer from reference plant genomes and using a variety of contemporary bioinformatics methods to assign peptide, structural and functional attributes. The openSputnik database is available at http://sputnik.btk.fi.},

  Abstract                 = {With recent technological advances, shared memory parallel machines have become more scalable, and offer large main memories and high bus bandwidths. They are emerging as good platforms for data warehousing and data mining. In This work, we focus on shared memory parallelization of data mining algorithms. We have developed a series of techniques for parallelization of data mining algorithms, including full replication, full locking, fixed locking, optimized full locking, and cache-sensitive locking. Unlike previous work on shared memory parallelization of specific data mining algorithms, all of our techniques apply to a large number of popular data mining algorithms. In addition, we propose a reduction-object-based interface for specifying a data mining algorithm. We show how our runtime system can apply any of the techniques we have developed starting from a common specification of the algorithm. We have carried out a detailed evaluation of the parallelization techniques and the programming interface. We have experimented with apriori and fp-tree-based association mining, k-means clustering, k-nearest neighbor classifier, and decision tree construction. The main results from our experiments are as follows: 1) Among full replication, optimized full locking, and cache-sensitive locking, there is no clear winner. Each of these three techniques can outperform others depending upon machine and dataset parameters. These three techniques perform significantly better than the other two techniques. 2) Good parallel efficiency is achieved for each of the four algorithms we experimented with, using our techniques and runtime system. 3) The overhead of the interface is within 10 percent in almost all cases. 4) In the case of decision tree construction, combining different techniques turned out to be crucial for achieving high performance.},

  Abstract                 = {Identification of dispersed repetitive elements can be difficult, especially when elements share little or no homology with previously described repeats. Consequently, a growing number of computational tools have been designed to identify repetitive elements in an ab initio manner, i.e. without using prior sequence data. Here we present the results of side-by-side evaluations of six of the most widely used ab initio repeat finding programs. Using sequence from rice chromosome 12, tools were compared with regard to time requirements, ability to find known repeats, utility in identifying potential novel repeats, number and types of repeat elements recognized and compactness of family descriptions. The study reveals profound differences in the utility of the tools with some identifying virtually their entire substrate as repetitive, others making reasonable estimates of repetition, and some missing almost all repeats. Of note, even when tools recognized similar numbers of repeats they often showed marked differences in the nature and number of repeat families identified. Within the context of this comparative study, ReAS and RepeatScout showed the most promise in analysis of sequence reads and assembled genomic regions, respectively. Our results should help biologists identify the program(s), if any, that is best suited for their needs.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite a wide distribution of transposable elements (TEs) in the genomes of higher eukaryotes, much of their evolutionary significance remains unclear. Recent studies have indicated that TEs are involved with biological processes such as gene regulation and the generation of new exons in mammals. In addition, the completion of the genome sequencings in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa has permitted scientist to describe a genome-wide overview in plants. In this study, we examined the positions of TEs in the genome of O. sativa. Although we found that more than 10\% of the structural genes contained TEs, they were underrepresented in exons compared with non-exonic regions. TEs also appeared to be inserted preferentially in 3'-untranslated regions in exons. These results suggested that purifying selection against TE insertion has played a major role during evolution. Moreover, our comparison of the numbers of TEs in the protein-coding regions between single copy genes and duplicate genes showed that TEs were more frequent in duplicate than single copy genes. This observation indicated that gene duplication events created a large number of functionally redundant genes. Subsequently, many of them were destroyed by TEs because the redundant copies were released from purifying selection. Another biological role of TEs was found to be the recruitment of new exons. We found that \~{} 2\% of protein-coding genes contained TEs in their coding regions. Insertion of TEs in genic regions may have the potential to be an evolutionary driving force for the creation of new biological functions.},

We first estimate the basic properties of number fluctuation of ordinary words that appear almost uniformly. Then, we focus on those words that show dynamic growth with a tendency to diverge on a certain day, and also news words, that are typical keywords for natural disasters, grow suddenly with the occurrence of events and decay gradually with time. In both cases, the functional forms of growth and decay are generally approximated by power laws with exponents around -1 for a period of about 80 days. Our empirical analysis can be applied for the prediction of word frequency in blogosphere.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Comparative mapping provides new insights into the evolutionary history of genomes. In particular, recent studies in mammals have suggested a role for segmental duplication in genome evolution. In some species such as Drosophila or maize, transposable elements (TEs) have been shown to be involved in chromosomal rearrangements. In this work, we have explored the presence of interspersed repeats in regions of chromosomal rearrangements, using an updated high-resolution integrated comparative map among cattle, man and mouse.RESULTS:The bovine, human and mouse comparative autosomal map has been constructed using data from bovine genetic and physical maps and from FISH-mapping studies. We confirm most previous results but also reveal some discrepancies. A total of 211 conserved segments have been identified between cattle and man, of which 33 are new segments and 72 correspond to extended, previously known segments. The resulting map covers 91\% and 90\% of the human and bovine genomes, respectively. Analysis of breakpoint regions revealed a high density of species-specific interspersed repeats in the human and mouse genomes.CONCLUSION:Analysis of the breakpoint regions has revealed specific repeat density patterns, suggesting that TEs may have played a significant role in chromosome evolution and genome plasticity. However, we cannot rule out that repeats and breakpoints accumulate independently in the few same regions where modifications are better tolerated. Likewise, we cannot ascertain whether increased TE density is the cause or the consequence of chromosome rearrangements. Nevertheless, the identification of high density repeat clusters combined with a well-documented repeat phylogeny should highlight probable breakpoints, and permit their precise dating. Combining new statistical models taking the present information into account should help reconstruct ancestral karyotypes.},

  Abstract                 = {Web 2.0 applications have attracted a considerable amount of attention because their open-ended nature allows users to create light-weight semantic scaffolding to organize and share content. To date, the interplay of the social and semantic components of social media has been only partially explored. Here we focus on Flickr and Last.fm, two social media systems in which we can relate the tagging activity of the users with an explicit representation of their social network. We show that a substantial level of local lexical and topical alignment is observable among users who lie close to each other in the social network. We introduce a null model that preserves user activity while removing local correlations, allowing us to disentangle the actual local alignment between users from statistical effects due to the assortative mixing of user activity and centrality in the social network. This analysis suggests that users with similar topical interests are more likely to be friends, and therefore semantic similarity measures among users based solely on their annotation metadata should be predictive of social links. We test this hypothesis on the Last.fm data set, confirming that the social network constructed from semantic similarity captures actual friendship more accurately than Last.fm's suggestions based on listening patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {The Shannon entropy is a standard measure for the order state of symbol sequences, such as, for example, DNA sequences. In order to incorporate correlations between symbols, the entropy of n-mers (consecutive strands of n symbols) has to be determined. Here, an assay is presented to estimate such higher order entropies (block entropies) for DNA sequences when the actual number of observations is small compared with the number of possible outcomes. The n-mer probability distribution underlying the dynamical process is reconstructed using elementary statistical principles: The theorem of asymptotic equi-distribution and the Maximum Entropy Principle. Constraints are set to force the constructed distributions to adopt features which are characteristic for the real probability distribution. From the many solutions compatible with these constraints the one with the highest entropy is the most likely one according to the Maximum Entropy Principle. An algorithm performing this procedure is expounded. It is tested by applying it to various DNA model sequences whose exact entropies are known. Finally, results for a real DNA sequence, the complete genome of the Epstein Barr virus, are presented and compared with those of other information carriers (texts, computer source code, music). It seems as if DNA sequences possess much more freedom in the combination of the symbols of their alphabet than written language or computer source codes.},

By the use of integral operator kernel functions, one can efficiently compute principal components in high-dimensional feature spaces, related to input space by some nonlinear mapfor instance, the space of all possible five-pixel products in 16 16 images.

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Systems biology requires accurate models of protein complexes, including physical interactions that assemble and regulate these molecular machines. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and affinity-purification/mass-spectrometry (AP-MS) technologies measure different protein-protein relationships, and issues of completeness, sensitivity and specificity fuel debate over which is best for high-throughput interactome' data collection. Static graphs currently used to model Y2H and AP-MS data neglect dynamic and spatial aspects of macromolecular complexes and pleiotropic protein function. Results: We apply the local modeling methodology proposed by Scholtens and Gentleman (2004) to two publicly available datasets and demonstrate its uses, interpretation and limitations. Specifically, we use this technology to address four major issues pertaining to protein-protein networks. (1) We motivate the need to move from static global interactome graphs to local protein complex models. (2) We formally show that accurate local interactome models require both Y2H and AP-MS data, even in idealized situations. (3) We briefly discuss experimental design issues and how bait selection affects interpretability of results. (4) We point to the implications of local modeling for systems biology including functional annotation, new complex prediction, pathway interactivity and coordination with gene-expression data.

This talk concentrates on the models of Christian Schulze et al and of Viviane de Oliveira et al which allow the simulation of a large number of languages, similar to today's 8,000 human languages. The first model deals with a continuous process of random mutations of a language, transfer from and to other languages, and flight away from languages spoken by only a few people. The second model combines these flight and mutation aspects, ignores transfer and describes the colonization of a large geographical region by people starting at one lattice point. The size of a language is defined by the number of people speaking it. The first model gives a realistic log-normal shape for the histogram of language sizes but the numbers are bad. For the second model our Monte Carlo simulations give sizes up to thousand million, but not the nearly log-normal shape. A meeting is planned for mid-September 2006 in Poland.},

  Abstract                 = {Photosynthetic starch reserves that accumulate in Arabidopsis leaves during the day decrease approximately linearly with time at night to support metabolism and growth. We find that the rate of decrease is adjusted to accommodate variation in the time of onset of darkness and starch content, such that reserves last almost precisely until dawn. Generation of these dynamics therefore requires an arithmetic division computation between the starch content and expected time to dawn. We introduce two novel chemical kinetic models capable of implementing analog arithmetic division. Predictions from the models are successfully tested in plants perturbed by a night-time light period or by mutations in starch degradation pathways. Our experiments indicate which components of the starch degradation apparatus may be important for appropriate arithmetic division. Our results are potentially relevant for any biological system dependent on a food reserve for survival over a predictable time period. DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00669.001.},

  Abstract                 = {In a combinatorial communication system, some signals consist of the combinations of other signals. Such systems are more efficient than equivalent, non-combinatorial systems, yet despite this they are rare in nature. Why? Previous explanations have focused on the adaptive limits of combinatorial communication, or on its purported cognitive difficulties, but neither of these explains the full distribution of combinatorial communication in the natural world. Here, we present a nonlinear dynamical model of the emergence of combinatorial communication that, unlike previous models, considers how initially non-communicative behaviour evolves to take on a communicative function. We derive three basic principles about the emergence of combinatorial communication. We hence show that the interdependence of signals and responses places significant constraints on the historical pathways by which combinatorial signals might emerge, to the extent that anything other than the most simple form of combinatorial communication is extremely unlikely. We also argue that these constraints can be bypassed if individuals have the socio-cognitive capacity to engage in ostensive communication. Humans, but probably no other species, have this ability. This may explain why language, which is massively combinatorial, is such an extreme exception to nature's general trend for non-combinatorial communication.},

  Abstract                 = {Communication involves a pair of behaviours--a signal and a response--that are functionally interdependent. Consequently, the emergence of communication involves a chicken-and-egg problem: if signals and responses are dependent on one another, then how does such a relationship emerge in the first place? The empirical literature suggests two solutions to this problem: ritualization and sensory manipulation; and instances of ritualization appear to be more common. However, it is not clear from a theoretical perspective why this should be the case, nor if there are any other routes to communication. Here, we develop an analytical model to examine how communication can emerge. We show that: (i) a state of non-interaction is evolutionarily stable, and so communication will not necessarily emerge even when it is in both parties' interest; (ii) the conditions for sensory manipulation are more stringent than for ritualization, and hence ritualization is likely to be more common; and (iii) communication can arise by a third route, when the intention to communicate can itself be communicated, but this may be limited to humans. More generally, our results demonstrate the utility of a functional approach to communication.},

  Abstract                 = {Intuitively, music has both predictable and unpredictable components. In this paper, we assess this qualitative statement in a quantitative way using common time series models fitted to state-of-the-art music descriptors. These descriptors cover different musical facets and are extracted from a large collection of real audio recordings comprising a variety of musical genres. Our findings show that music descriptor time series exhibit a certain predictability not only for short time intervals, but also for mid-term and relatively long intervals. This fact is observed independently of the descriptor, musical facet and time series model we consider. Moreover, we show that our findings are not only of theoretical relevance but can also have practical impact. To this end we demonstrate that music predictability at relatively long time intervals can be exploited in a real-world application, namely the automatic identification of cover songs (i.e., different renditions or versions of the same musical piece). Importantly, this prediction strategy yields a parameter-free approach for cover song identification that is substantially faster, allows for reduced computational storage and still maintains highly competitive accuracies when compared to state-of-the-art systems.},

Written text is one of the fundamental manifestations of language, and the study of its universal regularities can give clues about how our brains process information and how we, as a society, organize and share it. Still, only classical patterns such as Zipf's law have been explored in depth. In contrast, other basic properties like the existence of bursts of rare words in specific documents, the topical organization of collections, or the sublinear growth of vocabulary size with the length of a document, have only been studied one by one and mainly applying heuristic methodologies rather than basic principles and general mechanisms. As a consequence, there is a lack of understanding of linguistic processes as complex emergent phenomena. Beyond Zipf's law for word frequencies, here we focus on Heaps' law, burstiness, and the topicality of document collections, which encode correlations within and across documents absent in random null models. We introduce and validate a generative model that explains the simultaneous emergence of all these patterns from simple rules. As a result, we find a connection between the bursty nature of rare words and the topical organization of texts and identify dynamic word ranking and memory across documents as key mechanisms explaining the non trivial organization of written text.

  Abstract                 = {The explosive growth in the number of documents produced daily necessitates the development of effective alternatives to explore, analyze, and discover knowledge from documents. Document mining research work has emerged to devise automated means to discover and analyze useful information from documents. This work has been mainly concerned with constructing text representation models, developing distance measures to estimate similarities between documents, and utilizing that in mining processes such as document clustering, document classification, information retrieval, information filtering, and information extraction. Conventional text representation methodologies consider documents as bags of words and ignore the meanings and ideas their authors want to convey. It is this deficiency that causes similarity measures to fail to perceive contextual similarity of text passages due to the variation of the words the passages contain, or at least perceive contextually dissimilar text passages as being similar because of the resemblance of words the passages have. This thesis presents a new paradigm for mining documents by exploiting semantic information of their texts. A formal semantic representation of linguistic inputs is introduced and utilized to build a semantic representation scheme for documents. The representation scheme is constructed through accumulation of syntactic and semantic analysis outputs. A new distance measure is developed to determine the similarities between contents of documents. The measure is based on inexact matching of attributed trees. It involves the computation of all distinct similarity common sub-trees, and can be computed efficiently. It is believed that the proposed representation scheme along with the proposed similarity measure will enable more effective document mining processes. The proposed techniques to mine documents were implemented as vital components in a mining system. A case study of semantic document clustering is presented to demonstrate the working and the efficacy of the framework. Experimental work is reported, and its results are presented and analyzed.},

  Abstract                 = {In his recent bestseller The World Is Flat, Thomas Friedman argues that countries like the United States can no longer compete in the global economy on the basis of making and selling commodities. Their competitive edge increasingly comes from how well they produce products, services, and technologies that are new . . . special . . . non-standard-and thus not easily produced across the globe by competitors. In this paper, we look at the educational implications of this crisis-implications that are both profound and alarming. We argue that young people in the United States today are being prepared for "commodity jobs" in a world that will, very soon, only reward people who can do innovative work and punish those who can't. The problem is being exacerbated by a new equity gap, in which some students have access at home to the technologies they need to prepare for life in a digital world, but many do not-a problem made worse by current educational policies that focus on giving students standardized skills for standardized tests rather than preparation for creative thinking and innovative work. We argue that the time to tinker with schools, as we have done for decades, is over, and that the change we need is neither liberal nor conservative. We make the case here that the same technologies that are creating this crisis provide a potential solution, and we propose the concept of epistemic games as one way to solve this looming crisis of learning.

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Repetitive DNA sequences, besides having a variety of regulatory functions, are one of the principal causes of genomic instability. Understanding their origin and evolution is of fundamental importance for genome studies. The identification of repeats and their units helps in deducing the intra-genomic dynamics as an important feature of comparative genomics. A major difficulty in identification of repeats arises from the fact that the repeat units can be either exact or imperfect, in tandem or dispersed, and of unspecified length. Results: The Spectral Repeat Finder program circumvents these problems by using a discrete Fourier transformation to identify significant periodicities present in a sequence. The specific regions of the sequence that contribute to a given periodicity are located through a sliding window analysis, and an exact search method is then used to find the repetitive units. Efficient and complete detection of repeats is provided together with interactive and detailed visualization of the spectral analysis of input sequence. We demonstrate the utility of our method with various examples that contain previously unannotated repeats. A Web server has been developed for convenient access to the automated program. Availability: The Web server is available at http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/srf and http://www2.imtech.res.in/raghava/srf},

We perform numerical simulations based on the noticed phenomenon obtaining a good agreement with the real data. Finally, we propose a method to artificially prolong the duration of the discussion that relies on the entropy of emotional probability distribution.},

  Abstract                 = {The lexicon consists of a set of word meanings and their semantic relationships. A systematic representation of the English lexicon based in psycholinguistic considerations has been put together in the database Wordnet in a long-term collaborative effort. We present here a quantitative study of the graph structure of Wordnet to understand the global organization of the lexicon. Semantic links follow power-law, scale-invariant behaviors typical of self-organizing networks. Polysemy (the ambiguity of an individual word) is one of the links in the semantic network, relating the different meanings of a common word. Polysemous links have a profound impact in the organization of the semantic graph, conforming it as a small world network, with clusters of high traffic (hubs) representing abstract concepts such as line, head, or circle. Our results show that: (i) Wordnet has global properties common to many self-organized systems, and (ii) polysemy organizes the semantic graph in a compact and categorical representation, in a way that may explain the ubiquity of polysemy across languages.},

Nevertheless, automatic learning techniques frequently overlook these patterns. In this paper, we apply a learning technique based on the structural organization of the data in the attribute space to the problem of discriminating the senses of 10 polysemous words. Using two types of characterization of meanings, namely semantical and topological approaches, we have observed significative accuracy rates in identifying the suitable meanings in both techniques. Most importantly, we have found that the characterization based on the deterministic tourist walk improves the disambiguation process when one compares with the discrimination achieved with traditional complex networks measurements such as assortativity and clustering coefficient. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such deterministic walk has been applied to such a kind of problem. Therefore, our finding suggests that the tourist walk characterization may be useful in other related applications.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the more well-studied problems in data mining is the search for association rules in market basket data. Association rules are intended to identify patterns of the type: â€œA customer purchasing item A often also purchases item B.â€� Motivated partly by the goal of generalizing beyond market basket data and partly by the goal of ironing out some problems in the definition of association rules, we develop the notion of dependence rules that identify statistical dependence in both the presence and absence of items in itemsets. We propose measuring significance of dependence via the chi-squared test for independence from classical statistics. This leads to a measure that is upward-closed in the itemset lattice, enabling us to reduce the mining problem to the search for a border between dependent and independent itemsets in the lattice. We develop pruning strategies based on the closure property and thereby devise an efficient algorithm for discovering dependence rules. We demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness by testing it on census data, text data (wherein we seek term dependence), and synthetic data.},

  Abstract                 = {Writing about emotional experiences is associated with a host of positive outcomes. This study extended the expressive-writing paradigm to the realm of romantic relationships to examine the social effects of writing. For 3 consecutive days, one person from each of 86 dating couples either wrote about his or her deepest thoughts and feelings about the relationship or wrote about his or her daily activities. In the days before and after writing, instant messages were collected from the couples. Participants who wrote about their relationship were significantly more likely to still be dating their romantic partners 3 months later. Linguistic analyses of the instant messages revealed that participants and their partners used significantly more positive and negative emotion words in the days following the expressive-writing manipulation if the participants had written about their relationship than if they had written about their daily activities. Increases in positive emotion words partially mediated the relation between expressive writing and relationship stability.},

  Abstract                 = {Repetitive sequences are a major constituent of many eukaryote genomes and play roles in gene regulation, chromosome inheritance, nuclear architecture, and genome stability. The identification of repetitive elements has traditionally relied on in-depth, manual curation and computational determination of close relatives based on DNA identity. However, the rapid divergence of repetitive sequence has made identification of repeats by DNA identity difficult even in closely related species. Hence, the presence of unidentified repeats in genome sequences affects the quality of gene annotations and annotation-dependent analyses (e.g. microarray analyses). We have developed an enhanced repeat identification pipeline using two approaches. First, the de novo repeat finding program PILER-DF was used to identify interspersed repetitive elements in several recently finished Dipteran genomes. Repeats were classified, when possible, according to their similarity to known elements described in Repbase and GenBank, and also screened against annotated genes as one means of eliminating false positives. Second, we used a new program called RepeatRunner, which integrates results from both RepeatMasker nucleotide searches and protein searches using BLASTX. Using RepeatRunner with PILER-DF predictions, we masked repeats in thirteen Dipteran genomes and conclude that combining PILER-DF and RepeatRunner greatly enhances repeat identification in both well-characterized and un-annotated genomes.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:We have recently identified two large families of extinct transposable elements termed Short Interspersed DEgenerated Retroposons (SIDERs) in the parasitic protozoan Leishmania major. The characterization of SIDER elements was limited to the SIDER2 subfamily, although members of both subfamilies have been shown to play a role in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Apparent functional domestication of SIDERs prompted further investigation of their characterization, dissemination and evolution throughout the Leishmania genus, with particular attention to the disregarded SIDER1 subfamily.RESULTS:Using optimized statistical profiles of both SIDER1 and SIDER2 subgroups, we report the first automated and highly sensitive annotation of SIDERs in the genomes of L. infantum, L. braziliensis and L. major. SIDER annotations were combined to in-silico mRNA extremity predictions to generate a detailed distribution map of the repeat family, hence uncovering an enrichment of antisense-oriented SIDER repeats between the polyadenylation and trans-splicing sites of intergenic regions, in contrast to the exclusive sense orientation of SIDER elements within 3'UTRs. Our data indicate that SIDER elements are quite uniformly dispersed throughout all three genomes and that their distribution is generally syntenic. However, only 47.4\% of orthologous genes harbor a SIDER element in all three species. There is evidence for species-specific enrichment of SIDERs and for their preferential association, especially for SIDER2s, with different metabolic functions. Investigation of the sequence attributes and evolutionary relationship of SIDERs to other trypanosomatid retroposons reveals that SIDER1 is a truncated version of extinct autonomous ingi-like retroposons (DIREs), which were functional in the ancestral Leishmania genome.CONCLUSION:A detailed characterization of the sequence traits for both SIDER subfamilies unveils major differences. The SIDER1 subfamily is more heterogeneous and shows an evolutionary link with vestigial DIRE retroposons as previously observed for the ingi/RIME and L1Tc/NARTc couples identified in the T. brucei and T. cruzi genomes, whereas no identified DIREs are related to SIDER2 sequences. Although SIDER1s and SIDER2s display equivalent genomic distribution globally, the varying degrees of sequence conservation, preferential genomic disposition, and differential association to orthologous genes allude to an intricate web of SIDER assimilation in these parasitic organisms.},

  Abstract                 = {As indicated early by Charles Darwin, languages behave and change very much like living species. They display high diversity, differentiate in space and time, emerge and disappear. A large body of literature has explored the role of information exchanges and communicative constraints in groups of agents under selective scenarios. These models have been very helpful in providing a rationale on how complex forms of communication emerge under evolutionary pressures. However, other patterns of large-scale organization can be described using mathematical methods ignoring communicative traits. These approaches consider shorter time scales and have been developed by exploiting both theoretical ecology and statistical physics methods. The models are reviewed here and include extinction, invasion, origination, spatial organization, coexistence and diversity as key concepts and are very simple in their defining rules. Such simplicity is used in order to catch the most fundamental laws of organization and those universal ingredients responsible for qualitative traits. The similarities between observed and predicted patterns indicate that an ecological theory of language is emerging, supporting (on a quantitative basis) its ecological nature, although key differences are also present. Here, we critically review some recent advances and outline their implications and limitations as well as highlight problems for future research.},

  Abstract                 = {Human language defines the most complex outcomes of evolution. The emergence of such an elaborated form of communication allowed humans to create extremely structured societies and manage symbols at different levels including, among others, semantics. All linguistic levels have to deal with an astronomic combinatorial potential that stems from the recursive nature of languages. This recursiveness is indeed a key defining trait. However, not all words are equally combined nor frequent. In breaking the symmetry between less and more often used and between less and more meaning-bearing units, universal scaling laws arise. Such laws, common to all human languages, appear on different stages from word inventories to networks of interacting words. Among these seemingly universal traits exhibited by language networks, ambiguity appears to be a specially relevant component. Ambiguity is avoided in most computational approaches to language processing, and yet it seems to be a crucial element of language architecture. Here we review the evidence both from language network architecture and from theoretical reasonings based on a least effort argument. Ambiguity is shown to play an essential role in providing a source of language efficiency, and is likely to be an inevitable byproduct of network growth.},

  Abstract                 = {Eukaryotic genomes contain many endogenous retroviral sequences (ERVs). ERVs are often severely mutated, therefore difficult to detect. A platform independent (Java) program package, RetroTector(C) (ReTe), was constructed. It has three basic modules: (i) detection of candidate long terminal repeats (LTRs), (ii) detection of chains of conserved retroviral motifs fulfilling distance constraints and (iii) attempted reconstruction of original retroviral protein sequences, combining alignment, codon statistics and properties of protein ends. Other features are prediction of additional open reading frames, automated database collection, graphical presentation and automatic classification. ReTe favors elements >1000-bp long due to its dependence on order of and distances between retroviral fragments. It detects single or low-copy-number elements. ReTe assigned a retroviral' score of 890-2827 to 10 exogenous retroviruses from seven genera, and accurately predicted their genes. In a simulated model, ReTe was robust against mutational decay. The human genome was analyzed in 1-2 days on a LINUX cluster. Retroviral sequences were detected in divergent vertebrate genomes. Most ReTe detected chains were coincident with Repeatmasker output and the HERVd database. ReTe did not report most of the evolutionary old HERV-L related and MalR sequences, and is not yet tailored for single LTR detection. Nevertheless, ReTe rationally detects and annotates many retroviral sequences.},

While there is much research on algorithmic improvements, (2004), the actual performance of an application also depends on how well the program maps to the target hardware. This paper presents a performance study of two parallel bioinformatics applications HMMER (sequence alignment) and SVM-RFE (gene expression analysis), on Intel x86 based hyperthread-capable (2002) shared-memory multiprocessor systems. The performance characteristics varied according to the application and target hardware characteristics. For instance, HMMER is compute intensive and showed better scalability on a 3.0 GHz system versus a 2.2 GHz system. However, SVM-RFE is memory intensive and showed better absolute performance on the 2.2 GHz machine which has better memory bandwidth. The performance is also impacted by processor features, e.g. hyperthreading (HT) (2002) and prefetching. With HMMER we could obtain -75\% of the performance with HT enabled with respect to doubling the number of CPUs. While load balancing optimizations can provide speedup of -30\% for HMMER on a hyperthreading-enabled system, the load balancing has to adapt to the target number of processors and threads. SVM-RFE benefits differently from the same load-balancing and thread scheduling tuning. We conclude that compiler and runtime optimizations play an important role to achieve the best performance for a given bioinformatics algorithm.},

Though maintenance scheduling comes as an end stage in an airline operation, it has potential for cost savings. Maintenance scheduling is an easily understood but difficult to solve problem. Given a flight schedule with aircraft assigned to it, the aircraft maintenance-scheduling problem is to determine which aircraft should fly which segment and when and where each aircraft should undergo different levels of maintenance check required by the Federal Aviation Administration. The objective is to minimize the maintenance cost and any costs incurred during the re-assignment of aircraft to the flight segments. This paper provides a complete formulation for maintenance scheduling and a heuristic approach to solve the problem. The heuristic procedure provides good solutions in reasonable computation time. This model can be used by mid-sized airline corporations to optimize their maintenance cost. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we provide a theoretical quantitative framework for the study of phonological networks (PNs) for English by carrying out principled comparisons to null models, either based on site percolation or network growth models. In contrast to previous work, we mainly focus on null models that reproduce lower order characteristics of the empirical data. We find that artificial networks matching connectivity properties of the English PN are exceedingly rare, quantifying a previous conjecture that real world word repertoires have been assembled through the addition of new words obtained through small modifications of old words. Our null models are able to explain the "power-law-like" part of the degree distributions and generally retrieve qualitative features of the PN such as high clustering, high assortativity coefficient, and small-world characteristics. However, the detailed comparison to expectations from null models also points out significant differences, suggesting the presence of additional constraints in word assembly. Key constraints we identify are the avoidance of large degrees, the avoidance of triadic closure, and the avoidance of large non-percolating clusters.},

Specifically, we constructed a semantic network from both novels and news stories, with \$N\$ independent words as vertices or nodes, and edges or links allotted to words occurring within \$m\$ places of a given vertex; we call \$m\$ the word distance. We then used measures from complex network theory to distinguish between news and fiction, studying the minimal text length needed as well as the optimized word distance \$m\$. The literature samples were found to be most effectively represented by their corresponding power laws over degree distribution \$P(k)\$ and clustering coefficient \$C(k)\$; we also studied the mean geodesic distance, and found all our texts were small-world networks. We observed a natural break-point at \$k=\backslash sqrt\{N\}\$ where the power law in the degree distribution changed, leading to separate power law fit for the bulk and the tail of \$P(k)\$. Our linear discriminant analysis yielded a \$73.8 \backslash pm 5.15\%\$ accuracy for the correct classification of novels and \$69.1 \backslash pm 1.22\%\$ for news stories. We found an optimal word distance of \$m=4\$ and a minimum text length of 100 to 200 words \$N\$.},

This has left genome projects for some small eukaryotes without a system that addresses their needs. This paper reports on a new system, GLIMMERM, that was developed to find genes in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Because the gene density in P. falciparum is relatively high, the system design was based on a successful bacterial gene finder, GLIMMER. The system was augmented with specially trained modules to find splice sites and was trained on all available data from the P. falciparum genome. Although a precise evaluation of its accuracy is impossible at this time, laboratory tests (using RTPCR) on a small selection of predicted genes confirmed all of those predictions. With the rapid progress in sequencing the genome of P. falciparum, the availability of this new gene finder will greatly facilitate qthe annotation process.},

Phase I was a passive acoustic search for the aircraft's underwater locator beacons. Phases II and III were side-looking sonar searches scanning the ocean bottom for the wreckage field. In July of 2010 the French Bureau d'Enqu\&\#x00EA;tes et d'Analyses tasked Metron to review the searches and produce posterior probability maps for the location of the wreckage. These maps were used to plan the next phase of search beginning in March 2011. On April 3, after one week of search, the wreckage was located in a high probability area of the map.},

  Abstract                 = {There are global threats to biodiversity with current extinction rates well above background levels. Although less well publicized, numerous human languages have also become extinct, and others are threatened with extinction. However, estimates of the number of threatened languages vary considerably owing to the wide range of criteria used. For example, languages have been classified as threatened if the number of speakers is less than 100, 500, 1,000, 10,000, 20,000 or 100,000 (ref. 3). Here I show, by applying internationally agreed criteria for classifying species extinction risk, that languages are more threatened than birds or mammals. Rare languages are more likely to show evidence of decline than commoner ones. Areas with high language diversity also have high bird and mammal diversity and all three show similar relationships to area, latitude, area of forest and, for languages and birds, maximum altitude. The time of human settlement has little effect on current language diversity. Although similar factors explain the diversity of languages and biodiversity, the factors explaining extinction risk for birds and mammals (high altitude, high human densities and insularity) do not explain the numbers of endangered languages.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Extensive computational and database tools are available to mine genomic and genetic databases for model organisms, but little genomic data is available for many species of ecological or agricultural significance, especially those with large genomes. Genome surveys using conventional sequencing techniques are powerful, particularly for detecting sequences present in many copies per genome. However these methods are time-consuming and have potential drawbacks. High throughput 454 sequencing provides an alternative method by which much information can be gained quickly and cheaply from high-coverage surveys of genomic DNA.RESULTS:We sequenced 78 million base-pairs of randomly sheared soybean DNA which passed our quality criteria. Computational analysis of the survey sequences provided global information on the abundant repetitive sequences in soybean. The sequence was used to determine the copy number across regions of large genomic clones or contigs and discover higher-order structures within satellite repeats. We have created an annotated, online database of sequences present in multiple copies in the soybean genome. The low bias of pyrosequencing against repeat sequences is demonstrated by the overall composition of the survey data, which matches well with past estimates of repetitive DNA content obtained by DNA re-association kinetics (Cot analysis).CONCLUSION:This approach provides a potential aid to conventional or shotgun genome assembly, by allowing rapid assessment of copy number in any clone or clone-end sequence. In addition, we show that partial sequencing can provide access to partial protein-coding sequences.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:As the rough draft of the human genome sequence nears a finished product and other genome-sequencing projects accumulate sequence data exponentially, bioinformatics is emerging as an important tool for studies of transposon biology. In particular, L1 elements exhibit a variety of sequence structures after insertion into the human genome that are amenable to computational analysis. We carried out a detailed analysis of the anatomy and distribution of L1 elements in the human genome using a new computer program, TSDfinder, designed to identify transposon boundaries precisely.RESULTS:Structural variants of L1 elements shared similar trends in the length and quality of their target site duplications (TSDs) and poly(A) tails. Furthermore, we found no correlation between the composition and genomic location of the pre-insertion locus and the resulting anatomy of the L1 insertion. We verified that L1 insertions with TSDs have the 5'-TTAAAA-3' cleavage site associated with L1 endonuclease activity. In addition, the second target DNA cut required for L1 insertion weakly matches the consensus pattern TTAAAA. On the other hand, the L1-internal breakpoints of deleted and inverted L1 elements do not resemble L1 endonuclease cleavage sites. Finally, the genome sequence data indicate that whereas singly inverted elements are common, doubly inverted elements are almost never found.CONCLUSIONS:The sequence data give no indication that the creation of L1 structural variants depends on characteristics of the insertion locus. In addition, the formation of 5' truncated and 5' inverted L1s are probably not due to the action of the L1 endonuclease.},

Recognition of specialized pathogens is mediated by resistance proteins that function as molecular switches. Pathogen perception by these multidomain proteins seems to trigger a series of conformational changes dependent on nucleotide exchange. The activated resistance protein switches on host defenses, often culminating in the death of infected cells. Given their control over life and death, activity of these proteins requires tight regulation that involves intramolecular interactions between the various domains.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Microbial phenotypes are typically due to the concerted action of multiple gene functions, yet the presence of each gene may have only a weak correlation with the observed phenotype. Hence, it may be more appropriate to examine co-occurrence between sets of genes and a phenotype (multiple-to-one) instead of pairwise relations between a single gene and the phenotype. Here, we propose an efficient class association rule mining algorithm, NETCAR, in order to extract sets of COGs (clusters of orthologous groups of proteins) associated with a phenotype from COG phylogenetic profiles and a phenotype profile. NETCAR takes into account the phylogenetic co-occurrence graph between COGs to restrict hypothesis space, and uses mutual information to evaluate the biconditional relation. Results: We examined the mining capability of pairwise and multiple-to-one association by using NETCAR to extract COGs relevant to six microbial phenotypes (aerobic, anaerobic, facultative, endospore, motility and Gram negative) from 11 969 unique COG profiles across 155 prokaryotic organisms. With the same level of false discovery rate, multiple-to-one association can extract about 10 times more relevant COGs than one-to-one association. We also reveal various topologies of association networks among COGs (modules) from extracted multiple-to-one correlation rules relevant with the six phenotypes; including a well-connected network for motility, a star-shaped network for aerobic and intermediate topologies for the other phenotypes. NETCAR outperforms a standard CAR mining algorithm, CARAPRIORI, while requiring several orders of magnitude less computational time for extracting 3-COG sets.

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Repetitive DNA sequences are abundant in genomes and efficient mining of significant repeats is important as the first step of repetitive sequence research. Although many computational tools for the purpose, either automatic or visualization ones, have been developed, detection and analysis of approximate repeats are still non-trivial task. Results: Auto Dot PLOT (Adplot), a dotplot-like repetitive pattern visualization program with a window filtering based on iid Bernoulli trials, is developed and applied to yeast chromosomes and human T cell receptor locus sequence. Typical examples found in yeast chromosomes 1 and 10 and a tandem repeat of periods longer than 10 000 bp in human T cell receptor locus are presented. A complex structure composed of both direct and palindromic repeats found in yeast chromosome 10 is also visualized as specific dot pattern. Computational time measured by a Pentium 3 PC for each yeast auto chromosome with a standard parameter setting is linearly scaled and below 10 s per one chromosome, indicating efficiency of the program. From the examples, it is shown that Adplot can visualize approximate local repeat structures and give us a diagnosis power for inferring a duplicational history of repeats. Availability: Adplot can be obtained by an e-mail request.},

The web service works best with, but is not necessarily limited to, shorter fragments such as functional motifs--a task that most other tools do not perform well. Usual query times are in the order of seconds, allowing a truly interactive use.

  Abstract                 = { A total of 57.8 Mb of publicly available rice (Oryza sativa L.) DNA sequence was searched to determine the frequency and distribution of different simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in the genome. SSR loci were categorized into two groups based on the length of the repeat motif. Class I, or hypervariable markers, consisted of SSRs > or =20 bp, and Class II, or potentially variable markers, consisted of SSRs > or =12 bp <20 bp. The occurrence of Class I SSRs in end-sequences of EcoRI- and HindIII-digested BAC clones was one SSR per 40 Kb, whereas in continuous genomic sequence (represented by 27 fully sequenced BAC and PAC clones), the frequency was one SSR every 16 kb. Class II SSRs were estimated to occur every 3.7 kb in BAC ends and every 1.9 kb in fully sequenced BAC and PAC clones. GC-rich trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) were most abundant in protein-coding portions of ESTs and in fully sequenced BACs and PACs, whereas AT-rich TNRs showed no such preference, and di- and tetranucleotide repeats were most frequently found in noncoding, intergenic regions of the rice genome. Microsatellites with poly(AT)n repeats represented the most abundant and polymorphic class of SSRs but were frequently associated with the Micropon family of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) and were difficult to amplify. A set of 200 Class I SSR markers was developed and integrated into the existing microsatellite map of rice, providing immediate links between the genetic, physical, and sequence-based maps. This contribution brings the number of microsatellite markers that have been rigorously evaluated for amplification, map position, and allelic diversity in Oryza spp. to a total of 500.},

The dynamics of transposable elements, which provides the main mechanism of mutation in some genomes, is an essential component of genome evolution. In this study we introduce a new concept of domain, a segmentation unit useful for describing the architecture of different copies of transposable elements. Our method extracts occurrences of a terminus-defined family of transposable elements, aligns the sequences, finds the domains in the alignment and searches the distribution of each domain in sequences. After a classification step relatively to the presence or the absence of domains, the method results in a graphical view of sequences segmented into domains.Results: Analysis of the new non-autonomous transposable element AtREP21 in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana reveals copies of very different sizes and various combinations of domains which show the potential of our method.Availability: DomainOrganizer web page is available at www.irisa.fr/symbiose/DomainOrganizer/.},

The algorithm does not require a predetermined training set to estimate parameters of the underlying hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead, the anonymous genomic sequence in question is used as an input for iterative unsupervised training. The algorithm extends our previously developed method tested on genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster. To better reflect features of fungal gene organization, we enhanced the intron submodel to accommodate sequences with and without branch point sites. This design enables the algorithm to work equally well for species with the kinds of variations in splicing mechanisms seen in the fungal phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Zygomycota. Upon self-training, the intron submodel switches on in several steps to reach its full complexity. We demonstrate that the algorithm accuracy, both at the exon and the whole gene level, is favorably compared to the accuracy of gene finders that employ supervised training. Application of the new method to known fungal genomes indicates substantial improvement over existing annotations. By eliminating the effort necessary to build comprehensive training sets, the new algorithm can streamline and accelerate the process of annotation in a large number of fungal genome sequencing projects.},

Here we examine the performance of a simple associative learning algorithm for acquiring the referents of words in a cross-situational scenario affected by noise produced by out-of-context words. We find a critical value of the noise parameter \$\backslash gamma\_c\$ above which learning is impossible. We use finite-size scaling to show that the sharpness of the transition persists across a region of order \$\backslash tau\^{}\{-1/2\}\$ about \$\backslash gamma\_c\$, where \$\backslash tau\$ is the number of learning trials, as well as to obtain the learning error (scaling function) in the critical region. In addition, we show that the distribution of durations of periods when the learning error is zero is a power law with exponent -3/2 at the critical point.},

We find that large heterogeneity at the mesoscale level of the network appears to be a sufficient mechanism for the absence of a characteristic time for the dynamics. Such heterogeneity results in dynamical metastable states that survive at any time scale.},

The model represents texts in a formal manner, Subject Graphs, described herein, provides text handling operations whose inputs and outputs are identical in form, i.e. a set of subject graphs. We develop a graph-based text database, which is based on the model, and an interactive knowledge discovery system. Trials of the system show that it allows the user to interactively and intuitively discover knowledge in Web pages by combining text handling operations defined on subject graphs in various orders.},

  Abstract                 = {Identification of dispersed or interspersed repeats, most of which are derived from transposons, retrotransposons or retrovirus-like elements, is an important step in genome annotation. Software tools that compare genomic sequences with precompiled repeat reference libraries using sensitive similarity-based methods provide reliable means of finding the positions of fragments homologous to known repeats. However, their output is often incomplete and fragmented owing to the mutations (nucleotide substitutions, deletions or insertions) that can result in considerable divergence from the reference sequence. Merging these fragments to identify the whole region that represents an ancient copy of a mobile element is challenging, particularly if the element is large and suffered multiple deletions or insertions. Here we report PLOTREP, a tool designed to post-process results obtained by sequence similarity search and merge fragments belonging to the same copy of a repeat. The software allows rapid visual inspection of the results using a dot-plot like graphical output. The web implementation of PLOTREP is available at http://bioinformatics.abc.hu/PLOTREP/.},

  Abstract                 = {In the Life Sciences 'omics' data is increasingly generated by different high-throughput technologies. Often only the integration of these data allows uncovering biological insights that can be experimentally validated or mechanistically modelled, i.e. sophisticated computational approaches are required to extract the complex non-linear trends present in omics data. Classification techniques allow training a model based on variables (e.g. SNPs in genetic association studies) to separate different classes (e.g. healthy subjects versus patients). Random Forest (RF) is a versatile classification algorithm suited for the analysis of these large data sets. In the Life Sciences, RF is popular because RF classification models have a high-prediction accuracy and provide information on importance of variables for classification. For omics data, variables or conditional relations between variables are typically important for a subset of samples of the same class. For example: within a class of cancer patients certain SNP combinations may be important for a subset of patients that have a specific subtype of cancer, but not important for a different subset of patients. These conditional relationships can in principle be uncovered from the data with RF as these are implicitly taken into account by the algorithm during the creation of the classification model. This review details some of the to the best of our knowledge rarely or never used RF properties that allow maximizing the biological insights that can be extracted from complex omics data sets using RF.},

  Abstract                 = {One new thing often leads to another. Such correlated novelties are a familiar part of daily life. They are also thought to be fundamental to the evolution of biological systems, human society, and technology. By opening new possibilities, one novelty can pave the way for others in a process that Kauffman has called "expanding the adjacent possible". The dynamics of correlated novelties, however, have yet to be quantified empirically or modeled mathematically. Here we propose a simple mathematical model that mimics the process of exploring a physical, biological or conceptual space that enlarges whenever a novelty occurs. The model, a generalization of Polya's urn, predicts statistical laws for the rate at which novelties happen (analogous to Heaps' law) and for the probability distribution on the space explored (analogous to Zipf's law), as well as signatures of the hypothesized process by which one novelty sets the stage for another. We test these predictions on four data sets of human activity: the edit events of Wikipedia pages, the emergence of tags in annotation systems, the sequence of words in texts, and listening to new songs in online music catalogues. By quantifying the dynamics of correlated novelties, our results provide a starting point for a deeper understanding of the ever-expanding adjacent possible and its role in biological, linguistic, cultural, and technological evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {The regulation of transcriptional initiation in the human genome is a critical component of global gene regulation, but a complete catalog of human promoters currently does not exist. In order to identify regulatory regions, we developed four computational methods to integrate 129 sets of ENCODE-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation data. They collectively predicted 1393 regions. Roughly 47\% of the regions were unique to one method, as each method makes different assumptions about the data. Overall, predicted regions tend to localize to highly conserved, DNase I hypersensitive, and actively transcribed regions in the genome. Interestingly, a significant portion of the regions overlaps with annotated 3'-UTRs, suggesting that some of them might regulate anti-sense transcription. The majority of the predicted regions are >2 kb away from the 5'-ends of previously annotated human cDNAs and hence are novel. These novel regions may regulate unannotated transcripts or may represent new alternative transcription start sites of known genes. We tested 163 such regions for promoter activity in four cell lines using transient transfection assays, and 25\% of them showed transcriptional activity above background in at least one cell line. We also performed 5'-RACE experiments on 62 novel regions, and 76\% of the regions were associated with the 5'-ends of at least two RACE products. Our results suggest that there are at least 35\% more functional promoters in the human genome than currently annotated.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: One of the major features of genomic DNA sequences, distinguishing them from texts in most spoken or artificial languages, is their high repetitiveness. Variation in the repetitiveness of genomic texts reflects the presence and density of different biologically important messages. Thus, deviation from an expected number of repeats in both directions indicates a possible presence of a biological signal. Linguistic complexity corresponds to repetitiveness of a genomic text, and potential regulatory sites may be discovered through construction of typical patterns of complexity distribution. Results: We developed software for fast calculation of linguistic sequence complexity of DNA sequences. Our program utilizes suffix trees to compute the number of subwords present in genomic sequences, thereby allowing calculation of linguistic complexity in time linear in genome size. The measure of linguistic complexity was applied to the complete genome of Haemophilus influenzae. Maps of complexity along the entire genome were obtained using sliding windows of 40, 100, and 2000 nucleotides. This approach provided an efficient way to detect simple sequence repeats in this genome. In addition, local profiles of complexity distribution around the starts of translation were constructed for 21 complete prokaryotic genomes. We hypothesize that complexity profiles correspond to evolutionary relationships between organisms. We found principal differences in profiles of the GC-rich and other (non-GC-rich) genomes. We also found characteristic differences in profiles of AT genomes, which probably reflect individual species variations in translational regulation.

  Abstract                 = {Eight novel families of miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs) were discovered in the African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, by using new software designed to rapidly identify MITE-like sequences based on their structural characteristics. Divergent subfamilies have been found in two families. Past mobility was demonstrated by evidence of MITE insertions that resulted in the duplication of specific TA, TAA, or 8-bp targets. Some of these MITEs share the same target duplications and similar terminal sequences with MITEs and other DNA transposons in human and other organisms. MITEs in A. gambiae range from 40 to 1340 copies per genome, much less abundant than MITEs in the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Statistical analyses suggest that most A. gambiae MITEs are in highly AT-rich regions, many of which are closely associated with each other. The analyses of these novel MITEs underscored interesting questions regarding their diversity, origin, evolution, and relationships to the host genomes. The discovery of diverse families of MITEs in A. gambiae has important practical implications in light of current efforts to control malaria by replacing vector mosquitoes with genetically modified refractory mosquitoes. Finally, the systematic approach to rapidly identify novel MITEs should have broad applications for the analysis of the ever-growing sequence databases of a wide range of organisms.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel family of tRNA-related SINEs named gecko was discovered in the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Approximately 7200 copies of gecko were distributed in the A. aegypti genome with a significant bias toward A + T-rich regions. The 3' end of gecko is similar in sequence and identical in secondary structure to the 3' end of MosquI, a non-LTR retrotransposon in A. aegypti. Nine conserved substitutions and a deletion separate gecko into two groups. Group I includes all gecko that end with poly(dA) and a copy that ends with AGAT repeats. Group II comprises gecko elements that end with CCAA or CAAT repeats. Members within each group cannot be differentiated when the 3' repeats are excluded in phylogenetic and sequence analyses, suggesting that the alterations of 3' tails are recent. Imperfect poly(dA) tail was recorded in group I and partial replication of the 3' tandem repeats was frequently observed in group II. Genomic evidence underscores the importance of slippage retrotransposition in the alteration and expansion of the tandem repeat during the evolution of gecko sequences, although we do not rule out postinsertion mechanisms that were previously invoked to explain the evolution of Alu-associated microsatellites. We propose that the 3' tandem repeats and the poly(dA) tail may be generated by similar mechanisms during retrotransposition of both SINEs and non-LTR retrotransposons and thus the distinction between poly(dA) retrotransposons such as L1 and non-poly(dA) retrotransposons such as I factor may not be informative.},

Progress is hampered by the challenges presented by the complexity of the disease genetic data, including phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, polygenic forms of inheritance and variable penetrance, combined with the analytical and computational issues arising from the enormous number of potential interactions. We review here recent and current approaches focusing, wherever possible, on applications to real data (particularly in the context of genome-wide association studies) and looking ahead to the further challenges posed by next generation sequencing data.},

  Abstract                 = {{Summary: Suffix tree is one of the most fundamental data structures in string algorithms and biological sequence analysis. Unfortunately, when it comes to implementing those algorithms and applying them to real genomic sequences, often the main memory size becomes the bottleneck. This is easily explained by the fact that while a DNA sequence of length n from alphabet \{Sigma\} = \{A, C, G, T \} can be stored in n log |\{Sigma\}|= 2n bits, its suffix tree occupies O(n log n) bits. In practice, the size difference easily reaches factor 50. We provide an implementation of the compressed suffix tree very recently proposed by Sadakane (Theory of Computing Systems, in press). The compressed suffix tree occupies space proportional to the text size, i.e. O(n log\} | \{Sigma\} |) bits, and supports all typical suffix tree operations with at most log n factor slowdown. Our experiments show that, e.g. on a 10 MB DNA sequence, the compressed suffix tree takes 10\% of the space of normal suffix tree. Typical operations are slowed down by factor 60. Availability: The C++ implementation under GNU license is available at http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/suds/cst/. An example program implementing a typical pattern discovery task is included. Experimental results in this note correspond to version 0.95. Contact: vmakinen@cs.helsinki.fi},

  Abstract                 = {Controlled simulations of genome evolution are useful for benchmarking tools. However, many simulators lack extensibility and cannot measure parameters directly from data. These issues are addressed by three new open-source programs: GSIMULATOR (for neutrally evolving DNA), SIMGRAM (for generic structured features) and SIMGENOME (for syntenic genome blocks). Each offers algorithms for parameter measurement and reconstruction of ancestral sequence. All three tools out-perform the leading neutral DNA simulator (DAWG) in benchmarks. The programs are available at http://biowiki.org/SimulationTools.},

The completion of the sequencing of the rice nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes affords an opportunity to widen our understanding of the genomes of the genus Oryza. Research on the Oryza genus has begun to help to answer questions related to domestication, speciation, polyploidy and ecological adaptation that cannot be answered by studying rice alone. The wild relatives of rice have furnished genes for the hybrid rice revolution, and other genes from Oryza species with major impact on rice yields and sustainable rice production are likely to be found. Care is needed, however, when using wild relatives of rice in experiments and in interpreting the results of these experiments. Careful checking of species identity, maintenance of herbarium specimens and recording of genebank accession numbers of material used in experiments should be standard procedure when studying wild relatives of rice.},

  Abstract                 = {We have designed and evaluated four assays based upon PCR amplification of short interspersed elements (SINEs) for species-specific detection and quantitation of bovine, porcine, chicken, and ruminant DNA. The need for these types of approaches has increased drastically in response to the bovine spongiform encephalopathy epidemic. Using SYBR Green-based detection, the minimum effective quantitation levels were 0.1, 0.01, 5, and 1Â pg of starting DNA template using our bovine, porcine, chicken, and ruminant species-specific SINE-based PCR assays, respectively. Background cross-amplification with DNA templates derived from 14 other species was negligible. Species specificity of the PCR amplicons was further demonstrated by the ability of the assays to accurately detect trace quantities of species-specific DNA from mixed (complex) sources. Bovine DNA was detected at 0.005\% (0.5Â pg), porcine DNA was detected at 0.0005\% (0.05Â pg), and chicken DNA was detected at 0.05\% (5Â pg) in a 10-ng mixture of bovine, porcine, and chicken DNA templates. We also tested six commercially purchased meat products using these assays. The SINE-based PCR methods we report here are species-specific, are highly sensitive, and will improve the detection limits for DNA sequences derived from these species.},

However, the knowledge on the document side, i.e. the topics embedded in the documents, can help the context understanding and guide the sentence selection in the summarization procedure. In this paper, we propose a new Bayesian sentence-based topic model for summarization by making use of both the term-document and term-sentence associations. An efficient variational Bayesian algorithm is derived for model parameter estimation. Experimental results on benchmark data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed model for the multi-document summarization task.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Tandemly Repeated DNA represents a large portion of the human genome, and accounts for a significant amount of copy number variation. Here we present a genome wide analysis of the largest tandem repeats found in the human genome sequence.RESULTS:Using Tandem Repeats Finder (TRF), tandem repeat arrays greater than 10 kb in total size were identified, and classified into simple sequence e.g. GAATG, classical satellites e.g. alpha satellite DNA, and locus specific VNTR arrays. Analysis of these large sequenced regions revealed that several "simple sequence" arrays actually showed complex domain and/or higher order repeat organization. Using additional methods, we further identified a total of 96 additional arrays with tandem repeat units greater than 2 kb (the detection limit of TRF), 53 of which contained genes or repeated exons. The overall size of an array of tandem 12 kb repeats which spanned a gap on chromosome 8 was found to be 600 kb to 1.7 Mbp in size, representing one of the largest non-centromeric arrays characterized. Several novel megasatellite tandem DNA families were observed that are characterized by repeating patterns of interspersed transposable elements that have expanded presumably by unequal crossing over. One of these families is found on 11 different chromosomes in >25 arrays, and represents one of the largest most widespread megasatellite DNA families.CONCLUSION:This study represents the most comprehensive genome wide analysis of large tandem repeats in the human genome, and will serve as an important resource towards understanding the organization and copy number variation of these complex DNA families.},

After masking of known repetitive elements, IRF detected 22,624 human IRs characterized by arm size from 25 bp to >100 kb with at least 75\% identity, and spacer length up to 100 kb. This analysis required 6 h on a desktop PC. In all, 166 IRs had arm lengths >8 kb. From this set, IRs were excluded if they were in unfinished/unassembled regions of the genome, or clustered with other closely related IRs, yielding a set of 96 large IRs. Of these, 24 (25\%) occurred on the X-chromosome, although it represents only [\~{}]5\% of the genome. Of the X-chromosome IRs, 83.3\% were [\&ge;]99\% identical, compared with 28.8\% of autosomal IRs. Eleven IRs from Chromosome X, one from Chromosome 11, and seven already described from Chromosome Y contain genes predominantly expressed in testis. PCR analysis of eight of these IRs correctly amplified the corresponding region in the human genome, and six were also confirmed in gorilla or chimpanzee genomes. Similarity dot-plots revealed that 22 IRs contained further secondary homologous structures partially categorized into three distinct patterns. The prevalence of large highly homologous IRs containing testes genes on the X- and Y-chromosomes suggests a possible role in male germ-line gene expression and/or maintaining sequence integrity by gene conversion.},

  Abstract                 = {This article explores the types of racial and ethnic identities adopted by a sample of 83 adolescent second-generation West Indian and Haitian Americans in New York City. The subjective understandings these youngsters have of being American, of being black American, and of their ethnic identities are described and contrasted with the identities and reactions of first-generation immigrants from the same countries. Three types of identities are evident among the second generation - a black American identity, an ethnic or hyphenated national origin identity, and an immigrant identity. These different identities are related to different perceptions and understandings of race relations and of opportunities in the United States. Those youngsters who identify as black Americans tend to see more racial discrimination and limits to opportunities for blacks in the United States. Those who identify as ethnic West Indians tend to see more opportunities and rewards for individual effort and initiative. I suggest that assimilation to America for the second-generation black immigrant is complicated by race and class and their interaction, with upwardly mobile second- generation youngsters maintaining ethnic ties to their parents' national origins and with poor inner city youngsters assimilating to the black American peer culture that surrounds them.},

A strong focus for this debate has been a well-documented difference in early word learning: Infants' success in learning verbs lags behind their success in learning nouns.. In this review, we articulate both sides of the debate and summarize new cross-linguistic evidence from infants that underscores the role of universal features and begins to clarify the impact of distinctly different languages on early language and conceptual development.},

  Abstract                 = {Cot-based cloning and sequencing (CBCS) is a powerful tool for isolating and characterizing the various repetitive components of any genome, combining the established principles of DNA reassociation kinetics with high-throughput sequencing. CBCS was used to generate sequence libraries representing the high, middle, and low-copy fractions of the chicken genome. Sequencing high-copy DNA of chicken to about 2.7Ã— coverage of its estimated sequence complexity led to the initial identification of several new repeat families, which were then used for a survey of the newly released first draft of the complete chicken genome. The analysis provided insight into the diversity and biology of known repeat structures such as CR1 and CNM, for which only limited sequence data had previously been available. Cot sequence data also resulted in the identification of four novel repeats (Birddawg, Hitchcock, Kronos, and Soprano), two new subfamilies of CR1 repeats, and many elements absent from the chicken genome assembly. Multiple autonomous elements were found for a novel Mariner-like transposon, Galluhop, in addition to nonautonomous deletion derivatives. Phylogenetic analysis of the high-copy repeats CR1, Galluhop, and Birddawg provided insight into two distinct genome dispersion strategies. This study also exemplifies the power of the CBCS method to create representative databases for the repetitive fractions of genomes for which only limited sequence data is available.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Repetitive elements comprise \~{}45\% of mammalian genomes and are increasingly known to impact genomic function by contributing to the genomic architecture, by direct regulation of gene expression and by affecting genomic size, diversity and evolution. The ubiquity and increasingly understood importance of repetitive elements contribute to the need to identify and annotate them. We set out to identify previously uncharacterized repetitive DNA in the porcine genome. Once found, we characterized the prevalence of these repeats in other mammals.RESULTS:We discovered 27 repetitive elements in 220 BACs covering 1\% of the porcine genome (Comparative Vertebrate Sequencing Initiative; CVSI). These repeats varied in length from 55 to 1059 nucleotides. To estimate copy numbers, we went to an independent source of data, the BAC-end sequences (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute), covering approximately 15\% of the porcine genome. Copy numbers in BAC-ends were less than one hundred for 6 repeat elements, between 100 and 1000 for 16 and between 1,000 and 10,000 for 5. Several of the repeat elements were found in the bovine genome and we have identified two with orthologous sites, indicating that these elements were present in their common ancestor. None of the repeat elements were found in primate, rodent or dog genomes. We were unable to identify any of the replication machinery common to active transposable elements in these newly identified repeats.CONCLUSION:The presence of both orthologous and non-orthologous sites indicates that some sites existed prior to speciation and some were generated later. The identification of low to moderate copy number repetitive DNA that is specific to artiodactyls will be critical in the assembly of livestock genomes and studies of comparative genomics.},

  Abstract                 = {Natural languages are full of rules and exceptions. One of the most famous quantitative rules is Zipf's law which states that the frequency of occurrence of a word is approximately inversely proportional to its rank. Though this `law' of ranks has been found to hold across disparate texts and forms of data, analyses of increasingly large corpora over the last 15 years have revealed the existence of two scaling regimes. These regimes have thus far been explained by a hypothesis suggesting a separability of languages into core and non-core lexica. Here, we present and defend an alternative hypothesis, that the two scaling regimes result from the act of aggregating texts. We observe that text mixing leads to an effective decay of word introduction, which we show provides accurate predictions of the location and severity of breaks in scaling. Upon examining large corpora from 10 languages, we find emphatic empirical support for the universality of our claim.},

New algorithms are required to solve traditional mining problems without disclosing (original or derived) information of their own data to other parties. Research results have been developed on (i) incrementally maintaining the discovered association rules, and (ii) computing the distributed association rules while preserving privacy. However, no study has been conducted on the problem of the maintenance of the discovered rules with privacy protection when new sites join the old sites. We propose an algorithm SIMDAR for this problem. Some techniques we developed can even further reduce the cost in a normal association rule mining algorithm with privacy protection. Experimental results showed that SIMDAR can significantly reduce the workload at the old sites by up to 80\%.},

  Abstract                 = {Typically in neuroimaging we are looking to extract some pertinent information from imperfect, noisy images of the brain. This might be the inference of percent changes in blood flow in perfusion FMRI data, segmentation of subcortical structures from structural MRI, or inference of the probability of an anatomical connection between an area of cortex and a subthalamic nucleus using diffusion MRI. In this article we will describe how Bayesian techniques have made a significant impact in tackling problems such as these, particularly in regards to the analysis tools in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL). We shall see how Bayes provides a framework within which we can attempt to infer on models of neuroimaging data, while allowing us to incorporate our prior belief about the brain and the neuroimaging equipment in the form of biophysically informed or regularising priors. It allows us to extract probabilistic information from the data, and to probabilistically combine information from multiple modalities. Bayes can also be used to not only compare and select between models of different complexity, but also to infer on data using committees of models. Finally, we mention some analysis scenarios where Bayesian methods are impractical, and briefly discuss some practical approaches that we have taken in these cases.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Short sequence patterns frequently define regions of biological interest (binding sites, immune epitopes, primers, etc.), yet a large fraction of this information exists only within the scientific literature and is thus difficult to locate via conventional means (e.g. keyword queries or manual searches). We describe herein a system to accurately identify and classify sequence patterns from within large corpora using an n-gram Markov model (MM). Results: As expected, on test sets we found that identification of sequences with limited alphabets and/or regular structures such as nucleic acids (non-ambiguous) and peptide abbreviations (3-letter) was highly accurate, whereas classification of symbolic (1-letter) peptide strings with more complex alphabets was more problematic. The MM was used to analyze two very large, sequence-containing corpora: over 7.75 million Medline abstracts and 9000 full-text articles from Journal of Virology. Performance was benchmarked by comparing the results with Journal of Virology entries in two existing manually curated databases: VirOligo and the HLA Ligand Database. Performance estimates were 98 \{+/-\} 2\% precision/84\% recall for primer identification and classification and 67 \{+/-\} 6\% precision/85\% recall for peptide epitopes. We also find a dramatic difference between the amounts of sequence-related data reported in abstracts versus full text. Our results suggest that automated extraction and classification of sequence elements is a promising, low-cost means of sequence database curation and annotation. Availability: MM routine and datasets are available upon request. Contact: Jonathan.Wren@OU.edu},

The first strategy selects instances independently to maximize the change to a maximum entropy model using label propagation results in a gradient length measure of model change. The second strategy involves a batch criterion that integrates label uncertainty with diversity and density objectives. Experiments on sentiment classification demonstrate that both methods consistently improve over a standard active learning baseline, and that the batch criterion also gives consistent improvement over semi-supervised learning alone.},

The causes and evolutionary consequences of mobile element insertion, which have received considerable attention during the past decade, are reviewed in this article. Because of their unique mutational mechanisms, these elements are highly useful for answering phylogenetic questions. We demonstrate how they have been used to help resolve a number of questions in primate phylogeny, including the human-chimpanzee-gorilla trichotomy and New World primate phylogeny. Alu and LINE1 element insertion polymorphisms have also been analyzed in human populations to test hypotheses about human evolution and population affinities and to address forensic issues. Finally, these elements have had impacts on the genome itself. We review how they have influenced fundamental ongoing processes like nonhomologous recombination, genomic deletion, and X chromosome inactivation. Yrbk Phys Anthropol 50:2-19, 2007.

Ever-growing amount of genomic sequences of many organisms present a great challenge to fast identifying them. That is the first and indispensable step to study their structure, distribution, functions and other biological impacts. However, until today, tools for efficient LTR retrotransposon discovery are very limited. Thus, we developed LTR\_FINDER web server. Given DNA sequences, it predicts locations and structure of full-length LTR retrotransposons accurately by considering common structural features. LTR\_FINDER is a system capable of scanning large-scale sequences rapidly and the first web server for ab initio LTR retrotransposon finding. We illustrate its usage and performance on the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The web server is freely accessible at http://tlife.fudan.edu.cn/ltr\_finder/.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a numerical model of the network of two-Chinese-character compound words (two-character network, for short). In this network, a Chinese character is a node and a two-Chinese-character compound word links two nodes. The basic framework of the model is that an important character gets many edges. As the importance of a character, we use the frequency of each character appearing in publications. The direction of edge is given according to a random number assigned to nodes. The network generated by the model is small-world and scale-free, and reproduces statistical properties in the actual two-character network quantitatively.},

Phys. 15 093033, arXiv:1303.0705] is fundamentally impossible and leads to incorrect conclusions. Instead the text-length-dependence can be connected to the general properties of a random book with consistent agreement. It is pointed out that this finding has strong implications, when deciding between two conceptually different views on word-frequency distributions, i.e. the `Zipf's-view' and the `Randomness-view', as is discussed. It is also noticed that the text-length transformation of a random book does have an exact scaling property precisely for the power-law index \$\backslash gamma=1\$, as opposed to the Zipf's exponent \$\backslash gamma=2\$ and the implication of this exact scaling property is discussed. However a real text has \$\backslash gamma>1\$ and as a consequence \$\backslash gamma\$ increases when shortening a real text, contrary to the claim by Font-Clos et al in 2013 New J. Phys. 15 093033. The connections to the predictions from the RGF (Random Group Formation) and to the infinite length-limit of a meta-book are also discussed. The difference between `curve-fitting' and `predicting' word-frequency distributions is stressed.},

  Abstract                 = {The word-frequency distribution of a text written by an author is well accounted for by a maximum entropy distribution, the RGF (random group formation)-prediction. The RGF-distribution is completely determined by the a priori values of the total number of words in the text (M), the number of distinct words (N) and the number of repetitions of the most common word (k\_max). It is here shown that this maximum entropy prediction also describes a text written in Chinese characters. In particular it is shown that although the same Chinese text written in words and Chinese characters have quite differently shaped distributions, they are nevertheless both well predicted by their respective three a priori characteristic values. It is pointed out that this is analogous to the change in the shape of the distribution when translating a given text to another language. Another consequence of the RGF-prediction is that taking a part of a long text will change the input parameters (M, N, k\_max) and consequently also the shape of the frequency distribution. This is explicitly confirmed for texts written in Chinese characters. Since the RGF-prediction has no system-specific information beyond the three a priori values (M, N, k\_max), any specific language characteristic has to be sought in systematic deviations from the RGF-prediction and the measured frequencies. One such systematic deviation is identified and, through a statistical information theoretical argument and an extended RGF-model, it is proposed that this deviation is caused by multiple meanings of Chinese characters. The effect is stronger for Chinese characters than for Chinese words. The relation between Zipf's law, the Simon-model for texts and the present results are discussed.},

Similarly, confinement may have also played an important role for prebiotic compartmentalization in early life evolution when the cell membrane had not yet formed. It remains an open question how biochemical reactions developed without the confinement of cell membranes. Here we mimic the confinement function of cells by creating a hydrogel made from geological clay minerals, which provides an efficient confinement environment for biomolecules. We also show that nucleic acids were concentrated in the clay hydrogel and were protected against nuclease, and that transcription and translation reactions were consistently enhanced. Taken together, our results support the importance of localized concentration and protection of biomolecules in early life evolution, and also implicate a clay hydrogel environment for biochemical reactions during early life evolution.},

Analysis of MITE families is laborious and time consuming, especially when multiple MITE families are involved in the study. Based on the structural characteristics of MITEs and genetic principles for transposable elements (TEs), we have developed a computational tool kit named MITE analysis kit (MAK) to automate the processes (http://perl.idmb.tamu.edu/mak.htm). In addition to its ability to routinely retrieve family member sequences and to report the positions of these elements relative to the closest neighboring genes, MAK is a powerful tool for revealing anchor elements that link MITE families to known transposable element families. Implementation of the MAK is described, as are genetic principles and algorithms used in its derivation. Test runs of the programs for several MITE families yielded anchor sequences that retain TIRs and coding regions reminiscent of transposases. These anchor sequences are consistent with previously reported putative autonomous elements for these MITE families. Furthermore, analysis of two MITE families with no known links to any transposon family revealed two novel transposon families, namely Math and Kid, belonging to the IS5/Harbinger/PIF superfamily.},

We try to address the issue of language complexity empirically by comparing samples of the main English WP (Main) and the simple English WP (Simple). Simple is supposed to use a more simplified language with a limited vocabulary, and editors are explicitly requested to follow this guideline, yet in practice the vocabulary richness of both samples are at the same level. However, detailed analysis of longer units (n-grams rather than words alone) shows that the language of Simple is indeed less complex than that of Main. Comparing the two language varieties by the Gunning readability index supports this conclusion. We also report on the topical dependence of language complexity, e.g. that the language is more advanced in conceptual articles compared to person-based (biographical) and object-based articles. Finally, we investigate the relation between conflict and language complexity by analysing the content of the talk pages associated to controversial and peacefully developing articles, concluding that controversy has the effect of reducing language complexity.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: A huge amount of biomedical textual information has been produced and collected in MEDLINE for decades. In order to easily utilize biomedical information in the free text, document clustering and text summarization together are used as a solution for text information overload problem. In this paper, we introduce a coherent graph-based semantic clustering and summarization approach for biomedical literature.

RESULTS: Our extensive experimental results show the approach shows 45\% cluster quality improvement and 72\% clustering reliability improvement, in terms of misclassification index, over Bisecting K-means as a leading document clustering approach. In addition, our approach provides concise but rich text summary in key concepts and sentences.

CONCLUSION: Our coherent biomedical literature clustering and summarization approach that takes advantage of ontology-enriched graphical representations significantly improves the quality of document clusters and understandability of documents through summaries.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Microsatellite (simple sequence repeat - SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are two types of important genetic markers useful in genetic mapping and genotyping. Often, large-scale genomic research projects require high-throughput computer-assisted primer design. Numerous such web-based or standard-alone programs for PCR primer design are available but vary in quality and functionality. In particular, most programs lack batch primer design capability. Such a high-throughput software tool for designing SSR flanking primers and SNP genotyping primers is increasingly demanded.RESULTS:A new web primer design program, BatchPrimer3, is developed based on Primer3. BatchPrimer3 adopted the Primer3 core program as a major primer design engine to choose the best primer pairs. A new score-based primer picking module is incorporated into BatchPrimer3 and used to pick position-restricted primers. BatchPrimer3 v1.0 implements several types of primer designs including generic primers, SSR primers together with SSR detection, and SNP genotyping primers (including single-base extension primers, allele-specific primers, and tetra-primers for tetra-primer ARMS PCR), as well as DNA sequencing primers. DNA sequences in FASTA format can be batch read into the program. The basic information of input sequences, as a reference of parameter setting of primer design, can be obtained by pre-analysis of sequences. The input sequences can be pre-processed and masked to exclude and/or include specific regions, or set targets for different primer design purposes as in Primer3Web and primer3Plus. A tab-delimited or Excel-formatted primer output also greatly facilitates the subsequent primer-ordering process. Thousands of primers, including wheat conserved intron-flanking primers, wheat genome-specific SNP genotyping primers, and Brachypodium SSR flanking primers in several genome projects have been designed using the program and validated in several laboratories.CONCLUSION:BatchPrimer3 is a comprehensive web primer design program to develop different types of primers in a high-throughput manner. Additional methods of primer design can be easily integrated into future versions of BatchPrimer3. The program with source code and thousands of PCR and sequencing primers designed for wheat and Brachypodium are accessible at http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/demos/BatchPrimer3/.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Automated protein function prediction methods are needed to keep pace with high-throughput sequencing. With the existence of many programs and databases for inferring different protein functions, a pipeline that properly integrates these resources will benefit from the advantages of each method. However, integrated systems usually do not provide mechanisms to generate customized databases to predict particular protein functions. Here, we describe a tool termed PIPA (Pipeline for Protein Annotation) that has these capabilities.RESULTS:PIPA annotates protein functions by combining the results of multiple programs and databases, such as InterPro and the Conserved Domains Database, into common Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The major algorithms implemented in PIPA are: (1) a profile database generation algorithm, which generates customized profile databases to predict particular protein functions, (2) an automated ontology mapping generation algorithm, which maps various classification schemes into GO, and (3) a consensus algorithm to reconcile annotations from the integrated programs and databases.PIPA's profile generation algorithm is employed to construct the enzyme profile database CatFam, which predicts catalytic functions described by Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers. Validation tests show that CatFam yields average recall and precision larger than 95.0\%. CatFam is integrated with PIPA.We use an association rule mining algorithm to automatically generate mappings between terms of two ontologies from annotated sample proteins. Incorporating the ontologies' hierarchical topology into the algorithm increases the number of generated mappings. In particular, it generates 40.0\% additional mappings from the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) to EC numbers and a six-fold increase in mappings from COG to GO terms. The mappings to EC numbers show a very high precision (99.8\%) and recall (96.6\%), while the mappings to GO terms show moderate precision (80.0\%) and low recall (33.0\%).Our consensus algorithm for GO annotation is based on the computation and propagation of likelihood scores associated with GO terms. The test results suggest that, for a given recall, the application of the consensus algorithm yields higher precision than when consensus is not used.CONCLUSION:The algorithms implemented in PIPA provide automated genome-wide protein function annotation based on reconciled predictions from multiple resources.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary: The classification of protein sequences obtained from patients with various immunoglobulin-related conformational diseases may provide insight into structural correlates of pathogenicity. However, clinical data are very sparse and, in the case of antibody-related proteins, the collected sequences have large variability with only a small subset of variations relevant to the protein pathogenicity (function). On this basis, these sequences represent a model system for development of strategies to recognize the small subset of function-determining variations among the much larger number of primary structure diversifications introduced during evolution. Under such conditions, most protein classification algorithms have limited accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier that combines sequence and 3D structural averaging information. Each amino acid in the sequence is represented by a set of six physicochemical properties: hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, volume, surface area, bulkiness and refractivity. Each position in the sequence is described by the properties of the amino acid at that position and the properties of its neighbors in 3D space or in the sequence. A structure template is selected to determine neighbors in 3D space and a window size is used to determine the neighbors in the sequence. The test data consist of 209 proteins of human antibody immunoglobulin light chains, each represented by aligned sequences of 120 amino acids. The methodology is applied to the classification of protein sequences collected from patients with and without amyloidosis, and indicates that the proposed modified classifiers are more robust to sequence variability than standard SVM classifiers, improving classification error between 5 and 25\% and sensitivity between 9 and 17\%. The classification results might also suggest possible mechanisms for the propensity of immunoglobulin light chains to amyloid formation. Contact: cyu@bioanalysis.org},

Here, we investigate scientific evolution through systematic analysis of a massive corpus of digitized English texts between 1800 and 2008. Our analysis reveals remarkable predictability for long-prevailing scientific concepts based on the levels of their prior usage. Interestingly, once a threshold of early adoption rates is passed even slightly, scientific concepts can exhibit sudden leaps in their eventual lifetimes. We developed a mechanistic model to account for such results, indicating that slowly-but-commonly adopted science and technology surprisingly tend to have higher innate strength than fast-and-commonly adopted ones. The model prediction for disciplines other than science was also well verified. Our approach sheds light on unbiased and quantitative analysis of scientific evolution in society, and may provide a useful basis for policy-making.},

Based on features derived from automatically segmented tumor volumes from 101 DSC-MR examinations, four different SVM models were compared. All SVM models achieved high prediction accuracies (>82\%) after rebalancing the training data sets to equal amounts of samples per class. Best discrimination was obtained using a SVM model with a radial basis function kernel. A correct prediction of low-grade glioma was obtained at 83\% (true positive rate) and for high-grade glioma at 91\% (true negative rate) on the independent test data set. In conclusion, the combination of automated tumor segmentation followed by SVM classification is feasible. Thereby, a powerful tool is available to characterize glioma presurgically in patients.},

During the initial stage, popularity increases by imitation. As the people with the same name grow in number, however, its usage is inhibited and eventually decays.

An activator-inhibitor dynamical model for the interplay of the population bearing a name and the expecting couples wishing to give it to their children provides a satisfactory explanation of historical data from the Canadian province of Quebec during the twentieth century.},

  Abstract                 = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are one class of newly identified riboregulators of gene expression in many eukaryotic organisms. They play important roles in multiple biological and metabolic processes, including developmental timing, signal transduction, cell maintenance and differentiation, diseases and cancers. miRNAs regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by directly cleaving targeted mRNAs or repressing translation. Although the founding members of miRNAs were discovered by genetic screening approaches, experimental approaches were limited by their low efficiency, time consuming, and high cost. As an alternative, computational approaches were developed. Computational approaches for identifying miRNAs are based on the following major characteristics of miRNAs: hairpin-shaped secondary structures, high conservation for some miRNAs, and high minimal folding free energy index (MFEI). Computational approaches also play an important role in identifying miRNA targets. A majority of known miRNAs and their targets were identified by computational approaches. Several web-based or non-web-based computer software programs are publicly available for predicting miRNAs and their targets.},

Semantic MEDLINE, for example, summarizes semantic predications representing assertions in MEDLINE citations. Results are presented as a graph which maintains links to the original citations. Graphs summarizing more than 500 citations are hard to read and navigate, however. We exploit graph theory for focusing these large graphs. The method is based on degree centrality, which measures connectedness in a graph. Four categories of clinical concepts related to treatment of disease were identified and presented as a summary of input text. A baseline was created using term frequency of occurrence. The system was evaluated on summaries for treatment of five diseases compared to a reference standard produced manually by two physicians. The results showed that recall for system results was 72\%, precision was 73\%, and F-score was 0.72. The system F-score was considerably higher than that for the baseline (0.47).},

  Abstract                 = {Transposable elements (TEs) are the major component of plant genomes where they contribute significantly to the >1,000-fold genome size variation. To understand the dynamics of TE-mediated genome expansion, we have undertaken a comparative analysis of the TEs in two related organisms: the weed Arabidopsis thaliana (125 megabases) and Brassica oleracea (\{approx\}600 megabases), a species with many crop plants. Comparison of the whole genome sequence of A. thaliana with a partial draft of B. oleracea has permitted an estimation of the patterns of TE amplification, diversification, and loss that has occurred in related species since their divergence from a common ancestor. Although we find that nearly all TE lineages are shared, the number of elements in each lineage is almost always greater in B. oleracea. Class 1 (retro) elements are the most abundant TE class in both species with LTR and non-LTR elements comprising the largest fraction of each genome. However, several families of class 2 (DNA) elements have amplified to very high copy number in B. oleracea where they have contributed significantly to genome expansion. Taken together, the results of this analysis indicate that amplification of both class 1 and class 2 TEs is responsible, in part, for B. oleracea genome expansion since divergence from a common ancestor with A. thaliana. In addition, the observation that B. oleracea and A. thaliana share virtually all TE lineages makes it unlikely that wholesale removal of TEs is responsible for the compact genome of A. thaliana.},

These are disabled copies of functional genes that have been retained in the genome by gene duplication or retrotransposition events. Pseudogenes are important resources in understanding the evolutionary history of genes and genomes.Results: We have developed a homology-based computational pipeline ("PseudoPipe") that can search a mammalian genome and identify pseudogene sequences in a comprehensive and consistent manner. Pseudogenes are classified based on a combination of criteria including sequence homology, intron and exon structure, existence of stop codons and frameshifts, and other sequence features. This pipeline has been used to assign pseudogenes in a uniform and comparable fashion in a number of vertebrate genomes, including those of the human, mouse, rat, chimpanzee, chicken and dog.Availability: The PseudoPipe program is implemented in Python and can be downloaded at http://pseudogene.org/.},

  Abstract                 = {The comprehensive inventory of functional elements in 44 human genomic regions carried out by the ENCODE Project Consortium enables for the first time a global analysis of the genomic distribution of transcriptional regulatory elements. In this study we developed an intuitive and yet powerful approach to analyze the distribution of regulatory elements found in many different ChIP-chip experiments on a 10[\~{}]100-kb scale. First, we focus on the overall chromosomal distribution of regulatory elements in the ENCODE regions and show that it is highly nonuniform. We demonstrate, in fact, that regulatory elements are associated with the location of known genes. Further examination on a local, single-gene scale shows an enrichment of regulatory elements near both transcription start and end sites. Our results indicate that overall these elements are clustered into regulatory rich "islands" and poor "deserts." Next, we examine how consistent the nonuniform distribution is between different transcription factors. We perform on all the factors a multivariate analysis in the framework of a biplot, which enhances biological signals in the experiments. This groups transcription factors into sequence-specific and sequence-nonspecific clusters. Moreover, with experimental variation carefully controlled, detailed correlations show that the distribution of sites was generally reproducible for a specific factor between different laboratories and microarray platforms. Data sets associated with histone modifications have particularly strong correlations. Finally, we show how the correlations between factors change when only regulatory elements far from the transcription start sites are considered.},

  Abstract                 = {A complete set of candidate disease resistance ( R) genes encoding nucleotide-binding sites (NBSs) was identified in the genome sequence of japonica rice ( Oryza sativaL. var. Nipponbare). These putative R genes were characterized with respect to structural diversity, phylogenetic relationships and chromosomal distribution, and compared with those in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found 535 NBS-coding sequences, including 480 non-TIR (Toll/IL-1 receptor) NBS-LRR (Leucine Rich Repeat) genes. TIR NBS-LRR genes, which are common in A. thaliana, have not been identified in the rice genome. The number of non-TIR NBS-LRR genes in rice is 8.7 times higher than that in A. thaliana, and they account for about 1\% of all of predicted ORFs in the rice genome. Some 76\% of the NBS genes were located in 44 gene clusters or in 57 tandem arrays, and 16 apparent gene duplications were detected in these regions. Phylogenetic analyses based both NBS and N-terminal regions classified the genes into about 200 groups, but no deep clades were detected, in contrast to the two distinct clusters found in A. thaliana. The structural and genetic diversity that exists among NBS-LRR proteins in rice is remarkable, and suggests that diversifying selection has played an important role in the evolution of R genes in this agronomically important species.

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:The genus Oryza is composed of 10 distinct genome types, 6 diploid and 4 polyploid, and includes the world's most important food crop - rice (Oryza sativa [AA]). Genome size variation in the Oryza is more than 3-fold and ranges from 357 Mbp in Oryza glaberrima [AA] to 1283 Mbp in the polyploid Oryza ridleyi [HHJJ]. Because repetitive elements are known to play a significant role in genome size variation, we constructed random sheared small insert genomic libraries from 12 representative Oryza species and conducted a comprehensive study of the repetitive element composition, distribution and phylogeny in this genus. Particular attention was paid to the role played by the most important classes of transposable elements (Long Terminal Repeats Retrotransposons, Long interspersed Nuclear Elements, helitrons, DNA transposable elements) in shaping these genomes and in their contributing to genome size variation.RESULTS:We identified the elements primarily responsible for the most strikingly genome size variation in Oryza. We demonstrated how Long Terminal Repeat retrotransposons belonging to the same families have proliferated to very different extents in various species. We also showed that the pool of Long Terminal Repeat Retrotransposons is substantially conserved and ubiquitous throughout the Oryza and so its origin is ancient and its existence predates the speciation events that originated the genus. Finally we described the peculiar behavior of repeats in the species Oryza coarctata [HHKK] whose placement in the Oryza genus is controversial.CONCLUSION:Long Terminal Repeat retrotransposons are the major component of the Oryza genomes analyzed and, along with polyploidization, are the most important contributors to the genome size variation across the Oryza genus. Two families of Ty3-gypsy elements (RIRE2 and Atlantys) account for a significant portion of the genome size variations present in the Oryza genus.},

After the first of these international meetings, five years ago, Mary Lou Pardue and Wolfgang Hennig, in these columns, commented on its proceedings, and on heterochromatin in general. Although the questions that they raised cannot yet be answered exhaustively, important and sometimes surprising new observations have been made, some previously tentative answers have been firmed up, and some theoretical views underwent significant shifts. We wish to reflect here a few of the data presented at the second workshop, and express some thoughts suggested to us by these recent findings.},

We base our ideas on feature vectors and our method uses context during the translation of queries. Achieving good query translation can be difficult, due to short queries lacking context information. We argue that by using information external to the query, like ontologies and document collections, the effect of ambiguity and polysemi can be reduced. Different approaches for translation of these feature vectors are proposed and discussed.},
